# Feature Prioritization

**We all want to build the cool rocket ship.  But we have to be conscious that we’re building the thing. Users need, not the cool thing we want to make for the sake of it.**

The first reason for prioritizing features is avoiding featuritis: Excessive features to a product or service such that it becomes less valuable to customers.

Every project has resource limitations, including but not limited to **time, money, and people.** Research and design thinking methods generate a lot of ideas, but you won’t be able to build all of them at once. Even if we could implement every feature, it wouldn’t necessarily result in a usable product.

As a UX Designer, you will not typically be responsible for setting the project priorities by yourself. Instead, you will be working with the product and engineering teams to prioritize features by discovering:
-   which features add the most value to the business
-   which features are most valuable to the user
-   the technical feasibility of features within the timeframe of the project

Prioritization can’t be personal. You’re choosing the RIGHT feature for your company’s strategy and goals. Let’s look at a few different methods for prioritizing features.  
## Give Users Value, Not Features 
Looking ahead, your team will create several low-fidelity prototypes to test your assumptions about the value to the user. The more features, patterns, and interactions you add, the harder it is to interpret what is providing the most value. Let’s say you’re testing adding a rating system to your product. You could include the ability to add and edit comments, upvote reviews, add pictures, sort or filter products by review, flag reviews, and on and on. The problem is you don’t even know if users will value a rating system, much less whether they care about adding their pictures. 

**What is a minor possible thing you can learn from that will achieve the most significant amount of value?**

Following the [Pareto Principle](https://lawsofux.com/pareto-principle) (80/20 rule) will guide you to focus most of your effort on the insights and ideas that bring the most significant benefit to the most users. Since you haven’t done any product testing yet, you probably don’t know for sure what offers the best results for users. We leverage divergent thinking and strategy in the solution phase for this reason. But you have done research and synthesis that tells you where to focus the majority of your attention and limited time.  
## Limit Your Priorities
Having too many priorities during testing can lead to messy and inconclusive results. Go back to your persona or other user models, and speculate about what value you think a feature will deliver, both to the client and the user. Then make a plan to measure whether or not you are right. 

**You need to have some idea of what success looks like to judge which features are successful.**

If you haven’t already created some user models, try making some with your team now.  It will likely save time and effort in the long run. Unless you intend to hand them off to the client, you don’t have to make them look great–they can be internal thinking tools for your team.  
## Priority Matrix
The priority matrix is a quick and easy way to evaluate many ideas according to two criteria. Usually, this is done with a 2x2 diagram: one axis is Low to High Effort, and the other axis is Low to High Value. Anything that is High Effort and Low Value is eliminated or put in the backlog. Prioritize the Low Effort and High-Value quadrant.

An affinity diagram session should have shed light and in-depth insight into the user’s needs in the identified problem space. Feature prioritization is about making those needs more concrete by giving the team a way to evaluate the value of proposed features. In a sense, you are creating some helpful guidelines for your upcoming brainstorming sessions. Good designers know when to apply constraints to their process. Even though we use the double diamond model as a rough depiction of the design thinking process, if we were to zoom in, the process of coming up with ideas looks closer to the image below.
