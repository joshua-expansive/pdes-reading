# Color Models

When it comes to color mixing, there are two primary types of models to leverage: the additive color mixing model, also known as the pigment model, and the subtractive color mixing model, also known as the light model. These models rely on mixing primary colors to create a wide spectrum of colors, but depending on the model, there are varying sets of primary colors.

## CMYK

CMYK is an acronym for Cyan Magenta Yellow Black, colors used often in printing. The “K” also stands for “key ink” to reference the process of using black ink rather than mixing all three colors to create black, resulting in a purer black to create greater contrast and detail. CMYK is a subtractive mixing color model or pigment model where colors, like dyes, inks, and paints, are seen on physical surfaces because wavelengths are subtracted from the surface to create the color being seen by the eye. White is produced through the absence or subtraction of color or pigment, and all colors mixed produce black.

In the past, the colors used in the subtractive color mixing model were the well-known primary colors RYB (red, yellow, blue). As for color printing technology advanced, the RYB model was replaced with the CYMK (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black) model to provide for a broader range of colors on paper.

## RGB

In contrast, RGB, which stands for Red, Green, Blue, is an additive color mixing model or light model. We most commonly see these colors used for digital and online mediums, such as computer and television screens. This model is also known as the light model and is considered an additive process because white is produced by adding and mixing all of the colors of light; similar to how pure white light is created.

## HSB and HSL
Hue, Saturation, Brightness/Value (HSB)(HSV), and Hue, Saturation, Lightness (HSL) are considered alternative representations of the RGB color model. Developed in the 1970s, these two models were created to more closely mirror how human vision perceives color relationships and the traditional methods understood for mixing colors, such as in painting, making it easier for artists and designers to use and reference. For these users, it’s easier and more natural to think about a color in terms of hue and saturation than in terms of additive or subtractive color models.

-   Hue: Colors found on the color wheel or spectrum and the identifiers usually a number from 0 to 360 in degrees. Red is 0° (red is also 360°), Green is 120° and Blue is 240°
-   Saturation: The relative intensity, richness, or pureness of a hue. Vibrant colors have a high degree of saturation, while muted and faded colors have a low degree of saturation. Saturation ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 being the most saturated and purest form of the color or hue.
-   Value or Brightness: Along with saturation, brightness is the intensity of the color ranging from 0 to 100, with 100 being the most revealing of the hue and 0 being the darkest form making the color black.
-   Lightness: Lightness ranges from 0 to 50, with 50 being the most saturated/purest form of the hue and 0 being the darkest form (i.e. black).

While both models are leveraged for image editing and graphics applications, there’s an ongoing debate of which model is more intuitive for user interfaces. The most significant difference being in their final variable: lightness vs. brightness/value. While lightness refers to how white color is, value refers to how bright a color is. In other words, 100% lightness produces pure white, whereas 100% value/brightness can only produce pure white when set to 0% saturation.

## LAB
In 1976, the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) defined the CIELAB color model, more commonly known as LAB, for its three spatial components: Luminance (or lightness) and A and B (which are chromatic components). “A” specifies the color range from green to red, and B specifies the color ranges from blue to yellow. LAB is also a color model aimed to mimic human vision and, similar to HSB, designed to be device-independent outputting colors regardless of how they are created or displayed. Users of this model appreciate the change of the same amount in a color value produces a difference of about the same visual importance. This structure can provide a wider gamut of colors than CMYK or RGB and is often used in photo correction to provide more control over adjustment in photographs.
