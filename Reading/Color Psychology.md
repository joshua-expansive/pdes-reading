# Psychology of Color
 
 ## First impressions with color
 Color plays an integral part in defining your user interface design basics. Your choice of color directly impacts how users perceive the product you are presenting. It's an important, powerful tool to communicate your message. Color can set the basic mood, tone, concept, and connotation for a brand or product. According to the Institute of Color, users assess the quality of online products in 90 seconds. 62%-90% of those assessments are influenced by color.

 ## Associating emotions and mood by culture, age, gender
 
 Colors can stimulate an emotional reaction and set the mood at first glance. Several factors influence this reaction.
 
 ### Cultural Context
 There are cultural and contextual influences on how color is perceived, and it becomes a learned pattern that users associate with day to day. For example, where black conveys health and prosperity in far eastern culture, it connotates death and mourning in western culture.

### Gender
Physiologically, males and females are drawn to different colors as each has more retina sensitivity to preferred colors. Still, a part of it is a conditioned behavior and expectation. The modern world is working hard to consciously break the stereotypes generally associated with a 'pink for girls' and 'blue for boys' mentality.

### Industry and Context
Some industries have clear patterns for color and are used to establish trust, legitimacy, and offer context. For example, banks and financial companies would rarely have a bright yellow color palette. It doesn't offer the same credibility and trust a blue or green color would. The automobile industry also follows the same color patterns. You'd rarely see a baby pink logo for these brands.

Sometimes, however, breaking the mold or expectations set by the industry makes you stand out from the crowd. Differentiating can attract attention, especially when the user would compare the product to competitors.
