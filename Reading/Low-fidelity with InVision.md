# Low-fidelity Prototypes with InVision
---
## Benefits of low-fidelity prototypes
1.  **More time to work on design, before the test.** 
2.  **You can make quick iterations during the test.** 
3.  **Low-fidelity prototypes put less pressure on users.** Users may feel less obligated to "judge" your design, and be more likely to call out things that don't work, or any negative reactions.
4.  **Designers feel less precious about low-fidelity prototypes.** Designers are more likely to want to alter a sketch than a full-detailed design that they labored over.
5.  **Stakeholders will realize changes need to be incorporated.** When seeing a rough prototype, the expectation of the complete-ness of the project is better conveyed.

## To replace your screens
1.  Go to the screen you want to replace. 
2.  Drag and drop the updated image into the browser. The screen will be replaced. If you want to replace multiple screens, try doing so from the prototype home page. Click the upload screens and drag and drop all of the images to replace them.

Once replaced all hotspots, templates and comments will remain in place.

## To connect/link screens
Once you’ve uploaded your screens to InVision, you can use Build mode to create hotspots, overlays, and other interactions.

## To create hotspots
Hotspots link your prototype screens together. Depending on the project type (desktop, mobile, etc.), there are various behaviors.
1.  Open your prototype and navigate to the desired screen.
2.  At the bottom of the page, click the Build mode icon

3.  Click and drag around the desired hotspot area.
4.  In the hotspot pop-up modal, select the following options:
    -   **Link To:** Set the destination screen the hotspot will link to.
    -   **Click/Hover:** Determine whether clicking or hovering will trigger the hotspot. Hover is not available for mobile prototypes.
    -   **Maintain scroll position after click:** Check this box if you don't want the scroll position to reset after clicking the hotspot.
    -   **Include hotspot in template:** Check this box to duplicate a hotspot across multiple screens.
5.  Click **Save**.
6. To resize an existing hotspot, click and drag one of the corners.
