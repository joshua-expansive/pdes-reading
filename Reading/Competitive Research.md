# Competitive Research

## Why invest in competitive research?
Businesses cannot afford to rely on luck alone when creating new products. Every successful product or service has to find a competitive edge that differentiates it from what is already offered. Why should customers use your product idea over other solutions? Competitive research is all about finding out how you can stand out in some way. Will you compete on price, speed, simplicity, convenience, accessibility?

Competitive research coupled with credible user research sets you up to make better decisions during all stages of the design process. From a user perspective, it’s about understanding the context within which they make decisions–particularly the decision to adopt and remain loyal to your product.

Insights from competitive research will feedback into your design strategy in the form of decisions made along the way. But it also has several other benefits, including:
- Finding standards and best practices in that particular domain.
- Building more domain knowledge.
- Learn from mistakes and avoid “reinventing the wheel.”

## Who is your customer?
Remember, the customer is not everybody on the internet. By now, you have a good idea of who the primary customer segment will be. Any personas created will be based on the type of customer who needs your product to do a particular job to make progress on some goal. Your problem statement should also indicate who most needs the solution you intend to offer. The target segment should be specific–you want the type of customer who will rave about what your product does. The segments are a combination of demographic and psychographic attributes, but most important is that they concisely describe a set of people who are separate from everyone else. 

Examples:
- Aspiring artists who want their work to be easier to find online
- Parents in big cities who want their kids more involved in community activities

## Who is your competitor?
A competitor will have similar goals as you. Direct competitors (like Uber vs. Lyft) have very similar value propositions for the same type of customers. Indirect competitors have a different value proposition but might solve some of the same needs as you for the customer. (Uber vs. public transit). Or they might solve only part of the problem for your target market.

## Gathering the data
Before you begin, decide what attributes are most relevant. Competitive analysis can go pretty deep and be time-consuming. You’ll need to capture both quantitative and qualitative information, but don’t document metrics just for the sake of it. Define your goals for doing the research.  

### Typical goals for a competitive analysis
- First hand knowledge of the good and bad user experiences
- Industry trends
- Best practices
- Design conventions
- (Un)successful business models
- Marketing tactics
- Outdated mental models
    
Focus on the criteria you can best leverage into actionable insights. If you are working on a fitness app, you might go through the competitor’s end-to-end experience and begin to evaluate:
- Sign up & Login
- Rating for ease of syncing health data
- Main tasks
- Number of steps in task
- App store rating
- Feature comparison
    
The evaluation criteria will ultimately depend on what you need to inform your designs.

## Conducting the analysis
Turning the raw data into something actionable requires you to break the problem down into smaller pieces. To decide on the most appropriate course of action, you need a coherent view of what’s working and why, and how you plan to take advantage of what you learned. What essential features and opportunities are going to help you stand out in the market? How can you radically improve the customers’ lives in a way that makes them turn away from what’s already out there? It’s not about [cramming in all the same features as your competitors](https://steveblank.com/2010/03/01/death-by-analysis/). Instead, aim to use competitive intelligence to offer remarkable improvements in your problem space.  

Make sure to time block yourself for this step. It’s easy to go down rabbit holes when analyzing large quantities of data. Try to spend an equal amount of time on each competitor so you end up with a balanced perspective.
