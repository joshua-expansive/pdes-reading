# Interactive Digital Advanced Prototyping
Whether you create simple wireframes or fully functional mockups—prototyping is one of the essential skillsets any product designer can leverage. Click-through prototypes are relatively simple and help in establishing navigation patterns in a given user flow. As you progress, adding more detail to the prototype help designers test different things and mimic live product scenarios. 
## Interactive Mid-Fidelity Prototypes
Interactive prototypes are more advanced than click-through prototypes as they support interactivity in medium-fidelity visual design. Interactive prototypes are helpful when you are trying to pitch an abstract idea to stakeholders, explain design details to an engineer, or conduct a usability-test session to validate your design. Testing helps fix issues before production and saves time and money in the development stage.
- A variety of applications offer drag-and-drop user interfaces that make creating these prototypes a breeze, without any code required.
- They mimic the functionality without the time spent on creating fully-finished, aesthetically designed wireframes.

## Digital Hi-Fidelity Prototypes 
High-fidelity prototyping goes one step beyond the mid-fidelity interactive prototypes as it adds the final polish. Designers create aesthetically rich, interactive, and even animated product prototypes of a user interface almost ready for implementation. They are realistic looking and support more accurate testing of user-interface elements.

They are critical in getting a team’s final sign off on a product design before development begins and offer the following benefits:
-   They’re more realistic in terms of both visual design and functionality.
-   They require less imagination on the part of reviewers and approvers.

# Quiz
1. Designers should always skip to the highest fidelity of prototyping to ensure the idea is fully signed off on before development.
	- True
	- False (correct)

2. Interactive mid-fidelity prototypes require a working knowledge of code
	- True
	- False (correct)


3. Testing and getting sign off on digital or interactive prototypes is beneficial because
	- they help save time and money in development
	- they mimic what the end product would look like, so there are no surprises for the stakeholder
	- they support accurate testing of interface and interactive elements
	- all of the above (correct)
