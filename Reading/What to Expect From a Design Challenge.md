# Design Challenges
Design challenges are mini exercises that designers might do to strengthen or showcase their problem solving and design skills. Companies will often leverage design challenges as a way to provide opportunities for skill-building and team building. It’s also common for design professionals to leverage them to sharpen their skills or add to their portfolios. But perhaps the most discussed use case of design challenges is encountering one in a design interview.

When interviewing for a design position, it’s becoming increasingly common to receive a design challenge as a step in the process. These might also be called “design exercises,” “technical assessments,” or “technical interviews.” There are two main formats for interview design challenges: an at-home challenge or an onsite challenge. Hiring managers often leverage design challenges to understand better how a designer thinks and works through a problem. The focus is less about assessing the level of polish and more about evaluating how a designer demonstrates their process while working within various constraints.
## Take-home vs. onsite
Onsite challenges, commonly referred to as “whiteboard design challenges” are completed during an interview. The prompt is given itself or with a small amount of lead time. Then, hiring managers will assess how you walk others through your thought process. You’ll often be asked to talk out loud while you also sketch your thoughts and ideas out. For remote interviews, an “onsite” challenge might happen over a remote collaboration tool, such as [Miro](https://miro.com/) or [Mural](https://mural.co/). Or, it might focus more on talking through your approach rather than visualizing it.

Take-home challenges are given at various stages in the interviewing process and are expected to be completed on a designer’s own time. Depending on the company, prompts will drastically vary in format, timeframe, and complexity. While it’s still very much about getting a sense of your design approach, take-home challenges are often leveraged to assess technical capability. For example, you might receive an assignment that requires the use of specific software or tools or that asks for a specific outcome, such as a prototype.

No matter if you’re doing a take-home or onsite design challenge, there are a few best practices to keep in mind.
- **Understand the problem and goals.** If the problem you’re solving for or the desired goals is still unclear after the initial prompt and/or conversation, don’t hesitate to ask clarifying questions to understand the problem better. Often, hiring managers want to observe the types of questions you’ll ask to understand the problem and context better.
- **Understand the users and their needs.** Most likely you won’t get extensive data or information on who it is you’re designing for, so do your best to think through how you might go about getting some of that information. You can ask questions to the interviewer who might provide some context. Still, ultimately they’ll be interested in observing how you would go about narrowing down your target audience and putting together a plan of action to understand their needs better.
- **Don’t rush yourself.** While the nature of a design challenge is to work within tight time constraints,  the most important thing to remember is to slow down. Take time to strategize before jumping straight to solutions. Being able to think critically and determine what can reasonably be tackled within the given constraints showcases your experience as a designer.
- **Prioritize your time.** At the same time, it’s essential to recognize that you are working within a time constraint. Keep in mind that the goal is not to deliver a fully functional end product; it’s about demonstrating your critical thinking and decision-making processes. Based on your knowledge of the prompt, consider what areas would have the most significant impact so you could focus on them. If you’re doing an onsite challenge, make sure you have some way to do time checks throughout the exercise.
- **Show and tell.** Whenever possible, find ways to showcase your process. You can do this by simply jotting down and organizing your thoughts and ideas as you go. It is beneficial to both you and the person(s) interviewing you. It’ll help you remember important considerations or steps, and it’ll give your interviewer(s) more insight into how you’re thinking.
- **Iterate as you go.** Don’t be afraid to rethink and challenge your own ideas and solution as you work through them. This will show that you’re a thoughtful designer who’s not beholden to your first ideas. It’ll also showcase your critical thinking skills to be able to critique in the moment.
- **Leave time for a final review.** Just like any design work you do, do a final pass to ensure the details are clean and precise. Do some housekeeping and check for spelling, grammar as well as the fundamental design basics.
- **Be prepared to receive feedback.** Your interviewer might challenge some of your ideas and/or give you feedback to see how you respond to feedback. The key here is to stay calm and ask questions to better understand their feedback. From there, decide if it makes sense to incorporate their feedback or you might even find that it’s worth pushing back on their feedback. If the latter is true, make sure to do so professionally and with solid reasoning. 
- **Summarize your process.** Whether or not you’re doing a take-home or onsite challenge, you’ll want to be prepared to summarize what you did and why you did it. Keep your summary concise and high level. Communicate your overall approach and why you took that approach. Present where you landed at the end of the given time, recapping on points of interest or challenges that had a significant impact on your work. Lastly, discuss what your next steps would be if you were to continue working on this prompt. If you’re doing an onsite challenge, this can be tricky since you’ll be doing it in the moment. Manage your time appropriately to walk through this at the end.
