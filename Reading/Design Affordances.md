# Design Affordances
In product design, an **affordance** is something that the user can do with a physical object or digital interface. If this seems rather broad, it's because it is. The bulk of a product designer's work is creating, testing, and fixing affordances. 

> An affordance is a relationship between the properties of an object and the capabilities of the agent that determine just how the object could possibly be used. –Don Norman, *The Design of Everyday Things*

The actual term "affordance" is traced back to ecological psychologist J.J. Gibson. But Don Norman's explanation of the phrase in his book, "The Design of Everyday Things" brought it to a new audience of designers.

An affordance needs to communicate the correct information about how it can be used. Without this mediating information, many affordances would remain hidden or be used incorrectly. In some cases, this can [cause harm to people](https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/11/navy-ditches-touchscreens-for-knobs-and-dials-after-fatal-crash/). 

Although they are often spoken about in a binary fashion, **affordances exist in varying degrees.** In [How Artifacts Afford](https://www.jennyldavis.com/how-artifacts-afford-the-power-and-politics-of-everyday-things), Jenny L. Davis gives the example of a fence. A fence affords spatial separation but the intensity, or degree, of the affordance is determined by the type of fence. A rope fence *suggests*, a wood fence *tells* you to stay out, but an electric fence *insists*. Davis also situates affordances within existing social systems and their dynamics. The yellow tape around a crime scene has a stronger *situational* affordance even though it is much, much flimsier than a fence or wall. 
## A signifier provides information about how to use an affordance
A signifier could be any design choice, for example, color, text, size, animation, shape, texture, or tone. In the picture of the Stagg EKG kettle, what are some of the signifiers that provide information about the available affordances?

###### Signifier: a gradient denotes intensity in the sliders on the right panel. The affordance is the ability to change the setting. The signifier is the slider itself. Note that the arrows on each side of the slider are a different signifier for the same affordance. 
## Affordances in mobile design 
Phones and tablets rely on a different set of interactions since there is no physical interaction object as with a keyboard and mouse. There are certain universal affordances we've become used to in our devices despite many affordances being hidden.

## Five types of affordance
![](https://prodesigncurriculum.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/5-affordances.png)
### Cognitive
Cognitive affordances help the user know what they can do. Fundamentally, an affordance has to do with semantics–it's what the interface item *means*. It helps users accurately predict an outcome before taking an action.

###### Icons convey meaning which may change with context. [Phospher icons](https://phosphoricons.com)
Another use of cognitive affordance is giving feedback about an action the user initiates. When the user clicks a button, for example, they expect feedback from the system according to the success or failure of the action. 

Some visual elements contain intrinsic cognitive affordance, such as a door handle for pushing/pulling, or a doorknob for rotating. Other elements convey meaning because of shared cultural conventions. A [recent study](https://ojs.aaai.org//index.php/ICWSM/article/view/3224?source=post_page---------------------------) on how cultures express concepts via emoji showed very low correlation in emoji choice with the concepts: Insight, Number, Friend, Time, and Work. 

>  ‘Time’ is often viewed symbolically and is laden with cultural meaning; moreover,there are differences in the importance of keeping time and the timing of events (Brislin and Kim 2003). East Asians and Westerner also have differences in interpersonal dealings. With regard to the former, Confucianism places a premium on harmony and proper relationships as the basis for Asian society whereas Westerners often place greater importance in outcomes and direct communication.

### Emotional
> We know that emotion is important, though. It drives decisions. It motivates us to action. It builds bonds. Negative emotions can mean that people are frustrated enough not to complete what they started, too bored to stay engaged, or disappointed enough to switch brands altogether. Positive emotions not only diffuse problems, but potentially increase engagement in the moment—as a flow state or meaning making—and build attachment in the long term.

> –Pamela Pavliscak, Emotionally Intelligent Design

Emotional affordances connect to our sense of identity and meaning. People fall in love with products when they develop a sense of meaningfulness over time.

### Functional
Functional affordances connect users to the ability of the software behind the interface, typically in the backend. Functional affordances are good reminders that affordances exist even if they are not visible.

### Physical
