# Website Builders
Website builders aim to help users compose a website with the most ease by using pre-built components or widgets. Many offer drag and drop functionality as well as pre-designed templates from which to start. Many offer hosting and self-maintenance of the development, eliminating technical factors many users do not want to deal with. Some offer the ability to dive into the code if so pleased. Though some say website builders lack the robustness and flexibility for customization that popular CMS can provide, new and popular website builders have caught up to the needs of their users and have lots of integrations and services. 

Website builders are less likely to handle complex platforms and heavier data, making it challenging to make larger-scale data complex sites. Additionally, another drawback is website builders generally have recurring costs that are either monthly or annual.

## Popular website builders
A surprising number of designers start their portfolio on one platform and end up switching to the other platform out of frustration. Some designers prefer the structured parameters and super easy setup of Squarespace and WordPress, while others prefer the freedom and complete flexibility; some are frustrated by Squarespace's template limitations, while others are frustrated by the need to tweak every element in Webflow.

### Squarespace
Difficulty Level: Easy

[Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/) is the most well-known website platform with many templates that offer a lot of variety for layout for all user types. It was originally designed for e-commerce, so most templates are better for heavily visual sites and can be shaky when juggling large amounts of text. Depending on the template, it can offer interesting opportunities for customization and be highly rigid in those terms. The paid version offers a bit more flexibility and so may be worth exploring.

### Webflow
Difficulty Level: Slightly Hard

[Webflow](https://webflow.com/) is a platform that advertises complete freedom for the designer. It allows for limitless arrangement, but it usually requires a level of precision and review from the designer that they're not used to. If you're familiar with HTML and CSS but don't feel like hosting your portfolio, Webflow is a viable option.

If you're considering using Webflow, be sure you understand the following HTML terminology:
-   float
-   relative
-   absolute
-   and fixed positioning
-   Webflow hosting
-   Connect your domain
-   Free SSL certificate
