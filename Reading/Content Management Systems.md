# Content Management Systems
[Content Management Systems](https://www.zesty.io/mindshare/marketing-technology/what-is-a-content-management-system-cms-the-complete-guide/) are platforms that has a foundational structure in place to create, store and manage content that will eventually show in a website. The CMS will manage all of your content (HTML, images, hierarchy, and files) and stylings (color, brand, typography, and composition) all in an editable interface with needing to know little to no programming. Themes are simply templates that can be added to CMSs. They enable you to create stylish websites faster as the themes were designed already by someone else. If desired, CMSs allow for full customization as long as you understand the development language and code.

Additionally, many CMSs allow for extensions or plugins that expand the CMS’s features and your site. Adding the plugins is generally very easy and, because many are community-based, have grown to be standards in the world of CMSs. One of the significant benefits of using a CMS is generally you pay for it once if at all, as many are open source so free. 

The main drawback of using a CMS is that they have a more significant, steeper learning curve than their similar counterparts. More setup is required, so a bit of technical understanding is needed to get the system to work for your needs.

If you find a [theme](https://themeforest.net/category/wordpress/creative/portfolio) that works for your portfolio, WordPress can be pretty easy to install and use. A designer can leverage WordPress to get their portfolio up and running out-of-the-box layouts and templates.

Looking for a theme that has ‘page building’ capabilities will grant you more flexibility without the sweat of digging into the codebase.
