## Evaluating an existing product
You can evaluate the current state of a product using a few different methods, such as:
1.  **Heuristic evaluation:** Comparing an interface against predefined usability principles (called heuristics) to assess whether or not a product or platform aligns with user goals and expectations.
2.  **User testing:** Testing a product or platform with the actual end-user to evaluate the content, navigation, interaction, and overall usability.
3.  **Cognitive walkthrough:** Assessing a user’s understanding of a product or platform by which they accomplish specific goals.
## Heuristic Evaluations: The Ins and Outs
Of these methods, heuristic evaluation is the most frequently used and relied upon, making it a crucial step of the design process. Designers use heuristic evaluation to determine a design’s/product’s **usability** systematically. They go through a checklist of criteria to find flaws that design teams overlooked.

Using heuristic analysis to assess product usability is a good choice for a variety of reasons:
-   **It’s quick to learn:** This is a familiar and long-used technique with plenty of existing best practices and resources available online.
-   **It’s resourceful:** It doesn’t require much time, money, or resources in comparison to other methods such as user interviews, focus groups, etc.
-   **It’s flexible:** A heuristic analysis can be useful at any stage of the design process.
-   **It’s thorough:** Conducting even just one heuristic evaluation can address significant issues and minor inconsistencies within a design.
-   **It’s operational:** A usability chart will enable you to assess issues based on their severity so you can prioritize de-risking the product.

There are also a couple of downsides about heuristic analysis to keep in mind while running the evaluation and synthesizing results:
-   **Not everyone is an expert:** Junior designers who don’t have extensive knowledge about the industry, system design, and general best practices as a whole may negatively influence your evaluation. You may have to outsource to a professional if your product/platform is unusually niche.
-   **Inconsistencies within specific domains:** Sometimes, the heuristic principles you evaluate won’t lend themselves well to a particular product. Heuristic analysis might highlight usability issues that arose due to either cultural norms you’re unfamiliar with or prescriptive design directions that weren’t open-ended enough for the user base. Remedying this will require revisiting the heuristics (principles) used to assess whether they align with user goals and needs and those of the product and business.

## Conducting a Heuristic Evaluation
Knowing and understanding what to look for in an interface is critical in all evaluations. Running through the following criteria will serve for a successful heuristic evaluation:
1. **Use multiple evaluators.** Even the most trained eye won’t be able to identify all mistakes when combing through a product. Single heuristic evaluators, on average, catch around 35% of heuristic violations. There is a substantial benefit to including several evaluators as each individual offers a unique perspective and will notice different things. It is also important to note that each heuristic evaluation should be done independently by each evaluator.
2. **Select task to be evaluated.** When inspecting the usability of a product, there is generally a task or goal in mind for the “user” (in this case, it’s the evaluator) to accomplish. Keep that task in mind as you evaluate. It’s easy to get sidetracked and lose focus on the intention of each session.
3. **Create a scorecard.**  Use a scorecard for each task. At the top of the scorecard, record a description of the task. Then use either the columns or rows to input the usability heuristics.
4. **Decide severity ratings.** Included on this scorecard should be a **severity rating** assigned to each violation found. Typically these ratings are decided with two factors in mind: at what **frequency** does the problem occur? And what is the **impact** of the problem? Meaning how easy or difficult is the violation for users to overcome. A sample scorecard could look like this:
	- **1** = Cosmetic issue only: will not impact the usability and give the lowest priority
	- **2** = Minor usability issue: fixing this should be a low priority
	- **3** = Major usability issue: essential to improve, given higher priority
	- **4** = Usability emergency: must be resolved before the product can be released
5. **Evaluate** - Have each evaluator complete the task several times. The first time through, evaluators should be familiarizing themselves with the intended workflow. Understanding what is supposed to happen next should give evaluators a much better idea of what end-users need on any given step of that task. The following several times through, evaluators should be using the scorecard to record a description of each violation they find in the appropriate row or column and assign it a severity score. 
6. **Synthesize** - When all scorecards are complete, designers will have a much better idea of where usability issues exist within the product. Give priority to the violations scored highest using the severity ratings as designers iterate. 

### Additional Heuristics
The heuristics covered to this point are just a starting point. The designer may have followed a custom set of heuristics or design principles and you can use those to help evaluate the product. Use stakeholders or subject matter experts to help you establish baselines. 

Other heuristics might include:
- **Affordances** - Does the user understand what the text/graphic will do before they activate it?
- **Use chunking.** Write material so that documents are short and contain exactly one topic. Do not force the user to access multiple documents to complete a single thought.
- **Provide progressive levels of detail.** Organize information hierarchically, with general information appearing before more specific detail. Encourage the user to delve as deeply as needed and stop whenever they receive sufficient information.
- **Don’t lie to the user.** Does the product deliver what it promises? Is the system state represented accurately?
