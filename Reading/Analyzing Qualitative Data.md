# Analyzing Qualitative Data
User research generates a lot of qualitative data in the form of observations, transcripts, customer surveys, focus groups, diary studies, and customer feedback. This data can be summarized and made actionable through analysis to identify the main themes. Data might be attitudinal (people's thoughts, feedback, needs) or behavioral (observed). 

## Thematic analysis
Thematic analysis highlights the important aspects of qualitative data and makes it easier to find themes, patterns, and insights. It involves tagging individual observations or transcript quotes with specific **codes** that act as labels for a segment of text. A code describes, or tags, the content in the same way a keyword describes an article or a hashtag describes a tweet. Once the codes are assigned it's easy to compare segments of text that are about the same thing. You can sort or filter the information in order to uncover relationships, similarities, and differences in the segments.

Codes may be **descriptive** or **interpretive.** A descriptive code only describes what the data is about. An interpretive code adds the subjective interpretation of the researcher. 

Descriptive code: *How to find a doctor*. 
Interpretive code: *anxiety* 

The final step of a thematic analysis is to begin grouping all the data with the same code. This is similar to affinity mapping. This final step begins to reveal the themes that emerge from the analysis.
