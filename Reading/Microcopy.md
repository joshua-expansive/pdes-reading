# UX Microcopy
Microcopy is a short sentence or word that is targeted and highly contextual. It guides users to get started and do the next thing. Examples include error messages, captions, labels in forms, loading, buttons, etc. 
## Why it matters
Microcopy encourages the users, gains their trust, and empowers them. Surprisingly, these tiny words have a macro impact on the overall app design and ensuring the user and business goal is met. Minor tweaks can make a huge difference when you know where and what is causing user confusion via usability testing. 

In the following example, changing "Request a Quote" to "Request Pricing" saw a 161.66% increase in clicks to Veeam's lead gen form.

## Best practices
When working on microcopy, it's important to remember the following:
1. **Keep it short and straightforward** - being verbose adds to the cognitive load. Keeping copy direct ensures the message isn't lost or open to interpretation. It also capitalizes on the limited attention span of the user.
2. **Know your audience** - Since microcopy is all about making sure your customer is satisfied and trusts you, it is only natural that you have to know who you are pleasing and whose trust you are trying to gain. Be casual, serious, or funny based on user expectations around the task.
3. **Add personality** - Even error messages can be fun and quirky with a bit of thought. That interaction could change the frustration a user feels when things don't go right.

4. **Test often and iterate** - Checking for understanding is only possible when you recreate the context and scenario in which the user will interact with your product. By tweaking and testing bits of microcopy, you can make maximum impact on the end goal.
## More examples
The advantages of good microcopy include reducing user doubt in registering, subscribing or buying. It builds user trust and alleviates their fear of:
- **Spam** - Adding a small, empathetic phrase like, "We hate spam as much as you do," during email signup reassures your user that you won't bombard them with unnecessary emails.

- **Data loss** - users worry about losing important information as they go through a task. Letting them know they can access it later or that they will get it later settles their anxiety.

- **Irreversible changes** - Reminding users that they can change their input or settings at a later time encourages them to take a leap of faith.

- **Personal data security** Adding transparency to the microcopy reinsures users to trust the product. Effective microcopy should inform the user why personal information is being asked and how it will be used.
