# Inductive vs. Deductive Research
Doing problem space research means that you are dealing with people's social realities. This is squarely in the realm of "social science," which relies on insight-based observational study. The difference between this type of research and experiment-based research comes down to how they answer two questions: What is reality, and what is knowledge?

## The deductive approach
A **deductive** approach begins with a hunch (hypothesis) and seeks to establish scale and causation using experiments. 

**Question:** How long do most users spend using our app in a week?
**Research method:** device analytics
**Answer** (quantitative): An average of 1.24 hours per week
**Hunch:** If users had a better onboarding experience, they would use the app more. 
**Experiment:** Prototype and test an onboarding flow. 
**Result:** Hunch falsified.

## The inductive approach
In contrast, an **inductive** approach takes into account that people construct explanations that are true to them. And that this is valid data to collect for research. When combining data across multiple interviews, patterns and similarities emerge and signal to the design team that this is knowledge that should count. From that synthesis, a general explanatory theory can be framed. 

**Question:** Why are users only spending 1.24 hours per week using our app?
**Research method:** contextual interviews
**Answer** (qualitative): Users are unaware of advanced features. When they are aware, they aren't sure how using them will improve their workflow.

Some stakeholders aren't aware that these approaches have opposing logic. Qualitative data from user interviews doesn't have the same ring of "truth" as quantitative data from surveys or device analytics. So we often see an imbalance weighted toward quantitative, deductive approaches. But by itself, a deductive approach does not have the same explanatory power as inductive research. 

Deductive or inductive, quantitative or qualitative, each are valid research approaches. But we need to use the right one at the right time. A mismatch between the research question and the method type puts you at risk of only seeing part of the story.
