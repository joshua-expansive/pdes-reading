# Accessibility in Design
When it comes to inclusive and accessible design, designers must build empathy for users and meet them where they’re at. In the design world, accessibility is a vast subject that often gets boiled down to a simple set of requirements that designers go through the motions to follow as they design -- almost like a checklist, rather than an inclusive design process with innovative and empathetic thought. Accessibility requirements are essential and should be upheld by designers; however, they are not the be-all and end-all of accessible design. With increasing awareness around the importance of inclusion and accessibility in tech, designers must learn how to integrate more inclusive design approaches into their daily practice.

## Understanding Accessibility
To create accessible designs, you must first understand accessibility. The terms inclusive and accessible get used interchangeably. While there is significant overlap between inclusive design and accessible design, they are distinct from one another. Inclusive design is a methodology or process that focuses on designing for human diversity. Simultaneously, accessibility is more focused on the goal or outcome of a design, ensuring that the design provides the same opportunity and experience no matter a person’s capability or circumstance.

Accessibility is not exclusive to those who are hearing, visually, or learning impaired. The ideology of designing for accessibility often translates as “design for all.” \[Microsoft’s inclusive design toolkit\](https://www.microsoft.com/design/inclusive/) even goes on to define a “persona spectrum” that accounts for permanent, temporary, and situational scenarios. When creating personas, user scenarios, and use cases, consider a wide range of user types, needs, and contexts.

## Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)

When learning about accessibility, documentation like the \[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) guidelines\](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) and \[Google’s accessibility guides and resources\](https://www.google.com/accessibility/) can provide a strong foundation. The governing professional guidelines for web accessibility are in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). While accessible design certainly doesn’t stop at a checklist of guidelines (you should always strive to go above and beyond them in your Design Thinking), these WCAG 2.1 guidelines are considered the industry standard for ensuring web content is accessible to users. 

WCAG guidelines are an industry standard that most all businesses worldwide adhere to. They seek to “define how to make Web content more accessible to people with disabilities.” Each specific guideline contains testable success criteria that determine how accessible each facet of a digital product or service is. The product/service rates according to three conformance levels: Level A (lowest level of accessibility), Level AA (mid-range level of accessibility), or Level AAA (highest level of accessibility). Most companies and businesses strive to meet the requirements of Level AA conformance.
