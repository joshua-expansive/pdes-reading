# Organizing and Reporting Your Research Findings

## Organize early and often

To quickly find data collected later in the design process, Product Designers should consider organizing their research from when they first collect it. Organizing research early on would save time, effort and allow you to reapply your research insights later on. As you collect data and notes, consider organizing them right away.
 
 
## Don’t share raw data; convert them into key insights
Before we put in a system to organize our research, we have to ensure that we break them down into key insights or “UX nuggets.” To make it more digestible, creating key insights is a more effective way of sharing research knowledge.

## Group key insights

There are several methods for grouping your research insights, and you should use what works best for you. It’s best practice to add a date so you can gauge the relevance of your research:

- **By topic or theme:** 
	“New Customer Expectations - 2020”
	“Admin goals - 2021”
- **By product:** 
	“Marketing Website feedback - 2019” 
	“Native App Insights - February, 2020”
- **By feature:** 
	"Checkout flow feedback and expectations - 2018" 
	"Sharing and storing favorites - 2019"
- **By team:** 
	"Custumer Experience Team - 2021" 
	"Mobile Team User Research - August 2021"
- **By research study and date:** 
	“User Interviews - Mobile App - March 2019”
	“Usability Testing for Sign Up Process - June 2019”
