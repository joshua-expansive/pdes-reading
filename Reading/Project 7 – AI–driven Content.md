## Overview
For this project, you will take ownership of the entire design process research to final high-fidelity UI handoff. This project is meant to be done in three consecutive sprints, but the work can be spread across more sprints for the self-paced program. There is a significant focus on data privacy, ethical design, and presenting interactive information (quantitative and qualitative) to users. Information architecture and data visualization will play a key part. You will need to use all the skills (and a few new ones) you've learned during previous phases to complete this project. The project culminates in a final presentation to your project stakeholders. 

```ad-note
This project is unique in that *you* must decide what questions to ask and which methods will propel your research, synthesis, ideation, testing, and the final design recommendations. There are a few 'work smart' practices we recommend you follow for the best chance of success. 
1. Collaborate with your peers by working with the garage door open. Share your progress and your process. Use Miro, Mural, or Figjam to do group sharing sessions. 
2. Document your questions and decisions frequently.
3. Use a [kanban](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/boards) board to plan, prioritize, and track your tasks. 
4. Keep your documents, your research, and your Figma files organized.

## Background
Content creation is an extremely important element of any company, but it takes a long time to execute. Your client is a fast-moving startup that uses Artificial Intelligence to generate better quality content for agencies, marketing teams, creatives, content creators, and product managers. This tool caters to all needs from blogs to tweets to advertising copies. 

Currently, this capability only exists in code. Your job is to design the user experience and interface for Version 1 of a [progressive web app](https://web.dev/what-are-pwas/). 

The client has also asked for the following:
- goal-based persona based on user interviews
- high-fidelity designs for version 1 
- speculative fiction scenarios
### Functional capability 
*This list is what the platform is currently capable of doing. This does not necessarily mean the final designs must incorporate all capabilities. The client wants to make sure version 1 has the functionality users need the most. The client is also willing to add new capabilities if 1) value to users is established by research, and 2) they don't fall outside the constraints of their engineering means.*
- Users can type in headlines or body copy, select a destination platform, and the tool will return custom options that users can edit, save, copy/export.
- Users can define the voice & tone and keywords.
- Users can define an audience scope from very general to very specific.
- Users can optimize the output by flagging results that they like. Once a result is flagged, the model learns from it and performs even better in the future. 
- Users can view lists of grouped content.
### User needs 
*These user needs are based on informal early testing, but the client has asked for further validation. New user needs are expected to turn up through your research and testing.*
- Users need help visualizing the size of the audience-tuning capability. For example, selecting an audience of `males > 18-24` is a very broad audience. Adding interest demographics makes the audience smaller, but refines the content better: `males > 18-24 > Media & Entertainment Gamers`. By visualizing the size of the audience, users will be able to see the impact of their choices. 
- Users need to organize their content outputs, either grouped by channel (twitter, medium, blog, etc) or possibly by creating custom lists.
- Users would like the ability to change the interface's color theme.
### Potential users
- influencers
- marketers
- technical writers
- product managers
- journalists
- blog writers
### Branding concerns
The client, like many startups, will develop their brand around the visuals of the product. They would like the designs to reflect the market space they are competing in: content creation and AI. This will be a paid tool that offers three tiers of pricing, but Version 1 will launch with only a starter plan of $25/month aimed at individuals, entrepreneurs, freelancers, and small teams.
