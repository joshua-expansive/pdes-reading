# Evaluating and Converging Early Ideas
After a good brainstorming session or two, there comes a time when a decision is needed to move forward. To arrive at that decision, you need to evaluate the stockpile of ideas you’ve generated for viability, efficiency, and potential success. Moving from ideation (divergent thinking) into evaluation (convergent thinking) can sometimes feel like jumping head-first into cold water because it requires a significant switch in mindset.

But evaluation shouldn’t be a whiplash experience: In fact, you’ve probably already started evaluating towards a decision during the ideation process. For example, you might have identified some ideas that proved early on they just weren’t worth the time, or ideas that sparked some significant design pivots, or even some ideas that seemed like good fits and required greater effort to define further.

## Convergent thinking
During ideation, as you narrowed down options to arrive at your final list of ideas, you were naturally employing convergent thinking. This thought process leverages evaluation and decision-making strategies to identify the most viable solution instead of divergent thinking’s aim to generate an endless amount of possible solutions. A term first coined in 1956 by psychologist J.P. Guilford, convergent thinking is used in conjunction with divergent thinking for creative problem-solving.

Convergent thinking involves evaluating all options to make decisions while also encouraging further exploration and innovation. 

By evaluating every option with user research and the project’s needs in mind, you widen your ability to either build onto existing options or explore alternative approaches. You can use several methods to practice converging ideas, concepts, or problems in the design world.

## Evaluating early ideas
When evaluating design ideas and solutions, remember to consider the **viability, desirability, and feasibility** of each. Bill Moggridge -- designer, author, and co-founder of IDEO -- created a framework (see below) to visualize this unique overlap of considerations that designers often find themselves at the center of. You might have even seen a variation of this framework before, and it’s often referenced throughout the design industry to highlight how experience, design, and innovation often sit at the crossroads of people, technology, and business. By assessing how well each potential solution addresses the needs of the project, team, and business, you’ll quickly identify the most viable ideas.

While convergent thinking aims to narrow down on the best solution, that doesn’t mean it has to be the final one. Moving from divergence to convergence is not a linear process. In the Double Diamond model below, you’ll see that the two work best together when implemented as an iterative process. After you’ve spent some time evaluating and narrowing down your ideas, don’t be afraid to diverge again. This will allow you to identify better ideas and stronger solutions.
