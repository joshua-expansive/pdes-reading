# Gestalt Principles
## Overview
[Half of our brain's resources] are dedicated to vision. Different parts of the brain coordinate to process visual information such as color, size, shape, movement, and distinctions between overlapping objects. We've all seen optical illusions that remind us that what we "see" isn't necessarily what's there, but only our brain's interpretation.

 While humans do have control over their eye movements, most of the time our automatic processes run on auto-pilot. And this is a good thing since it would be exhausting to give an equal amount of attention to everything in our visual field! The Gestalt principles catalog the ways in which our brains take "shortcuts" when processing visual information.

Like [[What is Information Architecture?]], Gestalt is concerned with the process of making wholes out of parts. A useful illustration: imagine twelve people, each can hear exactly one of twelve notes of a melody. If you add up their experience, it's still not the same thing as if one person listened to the whole melody[^1]. You could transpose the notes to a different key and the melody, the whole, remains the same. 

Product designers can, and should, take advantage of the Gestalt principles in their visual design work. Ultimately, these principles are not just 'nice to haves,' they are fundamentally the way our brains process visual information. We'll return to these principles several times in the reading to remind you to evaluate your design work for their presence or absence. New principles will be introduced when they are most relevant, for instance when we look at animation and micro-interactions. 

## Composition
It's hard to study the Gestalt Principles without first understanding the concept of composition. For a design to have good composition, it must adhere to some general visual guidelines. There are no absolute rules, but designers have come to understand and agree that certain ways of designing just work better for the human visual-perceptual system. 


## Attraction and Grouping
It may seem strange to think of non-animated digital elements attracting or repelling one another. 

## Proximity
When information-rich objects (like text, photos, interface elements) are in close proximity space, people believe that they belong together and should be interpreted as having a relationship. Grouping unrelated objects confuses people because they interpret the "whole" as having a meaning. 

## Closure
Closure is related to Proximity. Our brains have a need to make wholes out of individual units. Think of it like connecting the dots where your brain supplies the missing connections in the negative space. The three dots in the image are randomly placed, but your mind still perceives the triangle.

Effective closure can be replicated with positive/negative space, contrast, and color. It's an easy way to reduce the overall number of elements needed for a design to be effective. The NBC logo is a well-known demonstration of closure.
