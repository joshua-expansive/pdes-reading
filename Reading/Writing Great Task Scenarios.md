# Writing Great Task Scenarios
A preliminary step in setting up evaluative research session is establishing the context for the user, also known as task scenarios. Users should understand why they would perform the task to help them make their own decisions and avoid overly guiding them in the provided task. By painting a scenario for the user, the researcher can then observe the entire process of the task and collect valuable data along the way instead of potentially brute-forcing the task’s success by cueing up small tasks individually. As an example, if a designer wants to test the usability of booking a flight, an appropriate task scenario could look like this: 

*You’re going on a vacation to Mexico from April 8th - April 12th. You will need to reserve a hotel as well as a flight each way. Go to the application and book the best deal according to your personal preferences.*

The [Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/task-scenarios-usability-testing/) recommends the following three principles when creating their task scenarios. 
## Make the task realistic
Having the user do something they wouldn’t normally do will make engaging with the interface more complicated. They will most likely try to ‘complete’ the task for the sake of completion instead of owning the task and treating it like their own experience. In the example, the user should be able to compare products based on their criteria.

**User goal**: Browse product offerings, then make a purchase.
**Poor task**: Purchase a pair of brown wool socks.
**Better task** Buy a pair of socks for less than $30.
    
## Make the task actionable
Encourage the user to show you how they would accomplish a task more than tell you how they would accomplish that task. At this point, we know that what users do doesn’t always align with what they say.

**User goal**: Find a restaurant and make a reservation.
**Poor task**: You want to go to dinner Tuesday evening. Go to www.opentable.com and tell me where you’d click next.
**Better task**: Use www.opentable.com to find a restaurant you’d be interested in eating at on Tuesday evening.

## Avoid giving clues and describing the steps
How task scenarios are written can sometimes bias the user because they can contain clues about how they can accomplish the task without needing to think critically.  

**User goal**: Get final exam grades from school.
**Poor task**: You want to see the results of the final exams. Go to the student portal, sign in, and tell me where you would click to get your updated transcript.
**Better task**: Look up the results of your final exams.

# Quiz
1. You read the following task scenario in a usability test designed to see how users prefer to find content on an online bookstore. What is wrong with the scenario? 
	"Pretend you are a doctor and you are looking for a specific medical journal. Visit the online bookstore journals section and use the search icon to find what you need." 
	1. The scenario does not align with the objective of the test because the participant is not using their own search criteria to find a journal. 
	2. It is not a realistic scenario if the participant must pretend to be a doctor.
	3. Both are true. (correct)
