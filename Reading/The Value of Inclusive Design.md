# Benefits of Inclusive Design
According to [Forrester Research](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2019/08/inclusive-design-an-overview-of-current-thinking.php), 60% of working-age adults in the US between 18 and 64 years old—or 101.4 million adults—are either likely or very likely to benefit from the use of accessible technology because of impairments that pose difficulties in using computers. That's a vast swath of the population. 

An inclusive design process can require additional time and resources, but it comes with many benefits.

**Inclusive design provides a better experience.** More people will be able to not only use our designs but have good experiences while doing so.
    
**It strengthens brand presence.** People notice when companies make their platforms and products more inclusive and accessible. It shows that the company values and recognizes human diversity, which makes people with similar values more likely to engage with the brand.

**It increases profitability.** From a business aspect, the wider the audience base means higher traffic on a platform which translates to higher revenue generated. [Center for Inclusive Design](http://centreforinclusivedesign.org/media/1186/inclusive-design-report-digital-160519.pdf) reported organizations have the potential to reach four times the number of intended consumers. A [Forrester Research Economic Impact Study](https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/#) commissioned by Microsoft concluded that accessibility could contribute to cost savings when it is integrated into existing and ongoing development cycles versus an afterthought. 

**It mitigates risk.** The company will also mitigate any legal repercussions and costs that can occur when a platform doesn’t meet specific human needs.
    
**It supports situational factors.** Designing for a diverse range of people also often accounts for situational factors or edge case scenarios.
