# Style Tiles for Ideation
Style Tiles are a design deliverable consisting of fonts, colors, and interface elements that communicate the essence of a visual brand for the web. Think of them as a step above mood boards and a step below high-fidelity mockups or screens for a digital product. Instead of random visuals jumbled together to create a “mood,” Style Tiles are more concrete and direct. 

## Style tiles help communicate ideas early
Style tiles are a tool designers leverage to communicate with the stakeholders and provide a catalyst for discussions around the preferences and goals of the client. They are relatively quick to make and allow the team to align on aesthetic and brand attributes before investing a lot of time and effort on fully designed mockups.

Once approved, the style tile serves as a launchpad for the designer into the entire design phase.

## The anatomy of a style tile
Style Tiles are specifically used for user interface design on websites, apps, or other digital products. Therefore, some key components are added in style tiles to give clients enough visual information to understand the final look and feel.

1. **Color Palette:** Include a primary color, a secondary color, and a color for emphasis. Even better is showcasing how you intend to use those colors: Headline? Background? CTA?
2. **Typographic styles:** Propose a hierarchy for your content by defining typography styles for headings (h1, h2, h3), body copy, links, labels, etc. This is especially important proposing to use two different font families within your design.
3. **Button styles:** In addition to defining the shape, style, color of your button, consider different states of buttons: active, disabled, hover, and clicked.
4. **Iconography:** Icons can be a powerful addition to your style tile, especially if yours have a particular design treatment that sets them from the bunch. Consider outline, fill, edges, or colors for differentiating your iconography.
5. **Visuals:** You may decide to use all photography or illustrations. However, defining what color, style, or mood of these visuals will go a long way in determining an aesthetic and getting early signoff from stakeholders on their interpretation of the brand direction.
6. **Voice and Tone:** Often, designers work with copywriters and marketing to identify and define the voice and tone in the product’s copy. It usually stems from pre-determined brand attributes. Add whether you propose the style to be expert, authoritative, serious, friendly and casual, pun-laden funny, sarcastic, etc.
