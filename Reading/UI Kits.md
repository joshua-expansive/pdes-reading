# UI Kits
Not every UI project requires you to design the visual elements from scratch. Here are a few scenarios when you might consider choosing a UI kit to speed up your process. 
1. If you are working with short project timeline or limited budget, researching, designing, and collaborating on a custom design system is probably out of the question. 
2. Kits are excellent for quickly drafting low-fidelity wireframes. 
3. When you are designing for a specific operating system (like MacOS or Android) you might need to use native components (like menus or radio controls) in your designs. Off-the-shelf libraries make it unnecessary to design these elements from scratch. 
4. If you are designing a web app, there are some excellent component libraries that you can customize for a brand.
