# A Hiring Manager's Perspective on Your Portfolio
Just like you would when designing a product or experience for your end-user, consider the audience for your portfolio website. Recruiters, hiring managers, and potentially hiring committees have unique goals and pain points that you must consider.

Consider the following when designing for the person you want to impress:
- **Time:** Hiring Managers and Recruiters often review 10-20 portfolios in one sitting. Their first look is to determine whether they should spend more time on your portfolio.
- **Context:** Consider whether you will be there to walk through your portfolio or whether a recruiter or HR person stumbles across your portfolio for their first impression.
- **Format:** Slide decks, a stand-alone website, or a case study on a Medium blog are all ways you can present your work based on your understanding of the context.

UX designers are sometimes in danger of telling too much in a case study because of the complexity of the design process. There may need to be some details consolidated or removed to make the story feel like it flows well to the reader. Remember, when in doubt, keep it simple and easy to digest. Shorter is always better. 

UI designers are often in danger of showing too much and writing too little on their design thinking. If you did any concepting on branding, show the multiple ideas and visual directions you designed and why you landed on those concepts. Show adaptability in your visual design and user interaction skills and work. Were you able to extend a kids’ brand versus a fashion line aesthetic? Did you showcase some clear or interesting interaction models? Lead with your visuals but don’t underestimate your supporting copy. 

Below is a baseline hiring manager checklist criteria. Though it’s essential to show you understood the challenge, method, and solution, what’s most critical for a hiring manager is understanding you are competent in design and product thinking and synthesis with varying levels of understanding of visual and interaction design. Have you answered these questions for the hiring manager concisely and effectively with your case study and portfolio?
-   Can the designer **research**?
-   Can the designer **synthesize**?
-   Can the designer **deliver visually consistent deliverables**?
-   Can the designer **show rationale for visual design decisions**?
-   Can the designer **think, ideate, and problem solve**?
-   Can the designer **validate with testing**?
-   Can the designer **express all of the above in a concise, direct manner**?
## Look and feel
To ensure that your story is noise-free and grabs the user's attention, pay close attention to being concise and compelling. Include polished deliverables and lead with visual artifacts while filling in the blanks with words. While doing so, test images with different devices, as well as proper resolution.
## Your contribution
Your ability to work well and collaborate with others is key to your success in your next job. Anything you share about your journey should include key moments of teamwork while still highlighting your contribution to the particular project.

Please don't be shy to give credit where it's due. For example, call out if another team member produced motion graphics for your video content. You can then mention that you managed the production of the video and helped with the storyboarding. 

Being honest about your work, and showing a thirst to learn more is an asset for a hiring manager. Speak honestly about some of the challenges you faced. Your story should include unexpected challenges in a professional environment and how you overcame them. This includes moments you encountered:
-   A difficult stakeholder
-   Negative feedback from the team or the users
-   Pivoting when your solution did not test well

Highlight these things that show **self-awareness**, **accountability**, and **resilience.**
## Confidentiality
Check with your client and ensure you can show your work with or without restrictions. If that means you need to password protect your work, that shouldn't bother the hiring manager.
