# Pixel Density

While it has many use cases, understanding and knowing pixel_density is useful when optimizing, resizing, or reformatting images without compromising quality.
## What is Pixel Density
[Pixel density](https://www.scientiamobile.com/capabilities/?search=pixel_density) is a calculation that returns the number of physical pixels per inch on a screen or display of a device. It’s often referred to as Pixels Per Inch or PPI.

## Post-Retina Display
After Apple introduced the Retina display in 2010, graphics had to be exported out to 2x or 3x to attain intended clarity. It became cumbersome and confusing for designers to export out images and icons at different pixel densities.
## Points and DIPs
The solution was using “Points” or “pt” for short. One point equates to 1 pixel on a pre-retina display or 2 pixels on a 2x retina display. They allow designers to qualify an icon as 44 _points_ tall, and then any device can multiply that by its pixel density ratio: like 1x, 2x, or 3x for Apple’s plus-sized iPhone.

Google has defined its density-independent unit for Android called “DIPs,” which stands for density-independent pixels. The shorthand is “dp.” They, too, are a universal unit of measurement that can be converted to pixels using a device’s scaling ratio (2x, 3x, etc.).

These days most devices on every operating system support a high PPI/DPI (dots per inch) screen and follow two rules:
- Design in Vector
- Design at 1x

	- seeing how heavy or light the interface looks

2. Points are a density-independent unit that allows users to design with scale.
	- True (correct)
	- False

3. Designers must design everything at 3x and then scale down for optimum results.
	- True
	- False (correct)
