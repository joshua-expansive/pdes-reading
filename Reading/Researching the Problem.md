# Researching the Problem
Why do many new products fail despite heavy investment in research and design? [Indi Young points](https://medium.com/inclusive-software/yes-to-problem-space-research-df97aa69edf9) out not all research is fit to reveal problems worth solving. When a company performs research, they are likely to focus only on their existing solutions and ideas. This tendency to limit research to where it is easiest to look is like the [streetlight effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streetlight_effect).

The urge to start solving problems as fast as possible is reinforced by popular slogans in the tech industry like, "Move fast and break things." *Lean UX*, a process framework popular with startups, advocates a hypothesis-driven approach that works in short, continuous cycles. Lean UX was created in 2013 to better integrate design work into the different *Agile* methods that have become a default way of working for many software teams. 
## Don't solve *a* problem, solve *the* problem
Teams typically begin with a hypothesis or idea–a problem they want to solve. Then they start to experiment and test that idea, searching for validation. It sounds a lot like the scientific method: learn by making. The problem is that experimentation *is* the research. The "ideas" do not come from a deep understanding of **people** and a problem that is **important**. Since the team can only view their experiment results through the narrow lens of their idea, they've probably missed critical data points. 

Thomas Edison said, "I haven't failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work." The scientific method has, unquestionably, brought about incredible advancements in every domain. However, relying only on experimentation and testing can optimize the *wrong* thing the *right* way. 

For a new product or feature to be successful you need three things: 
1. Solve a problem that actually exists
2. Solve an important problem
3. Quality of execution

The phrase "correlation does not equal causation" reminds us that just because we observed behavior and an outcome does not mean the behavior caused the outcome. When studying human beings' messy lives, it's worth the time to do the proper foundational research. Sometimes it's best to hold off on *doing* so you can first focus on the *defining*.
## Problem space vs. solution space

Imagine you work for a company that lets people document, organize, and share the most important memories from their travels, all from an app on their phone. Your product team has a large backlog of new features and ideas to make the user experience better and more delightful. And the ideas aren't random–they are all based on research: user interviews, device analytics, and observing customers use the product. The team even conducted a field research study by selecting users to keep a diary of how they used the app during their travels. 
### Understanding people's larger purpose
All of this is solid UX research work. But it ignores the deeper purposes that people have for travel. To get to this deeper reasoning, you have to talk to people who do not have a relationship with your company or product. After all, **most people are accomplishing similar purposes without using your product.** Conducting problem space research requires you to step outside of your role as a "designer-of-solutions" and become curious about *why* people do the things they do. 

A helpful way to think about "purposes" is to think about how someone who lived 100 years ago achieved a similar outcome. People have been traveling for pleasure long before they could capture memories and instantaneously share them with the world via their devices.

###### These purposes exist outside of a particular solution. Someone who lived 100 years ago might have similar purposes for travel. 

## The risk of not knowing **why** 
Teams that ignore the problem space can develop costly blind spots. Businesses put themselves at risk by neglecting hidden externalities and unintended consequences. So why isn't everyone doing problem space research? The easy answer is that it's difficult and time-consuming to get to the level of depth with people that problem space research requires. The tougher answer is that many businesses are comfortable with the practices and assumptions that brought them to where they are.

## Spending time with people
To begin foundational research, a great place to start is listening to people who have done some deep thinking around the purpose you are interested in. For the travel companion app, the product team should talk to people who match the criteria around the chosen purpose. If the purpose is to "experience adventure rather than planning," you need to hear stories from travelers who don't use guidebooks or do any planning before a trip. By teasing out their inner thinking, motivations, and emotional reactions, the team gains important insight into how their product could support the purpose. 

This type of research results in **cognitive empathy**, meaning that you understand someones thinking as they pursue their purpose.

# Quiz: Researching the Problem Space
1. Jess is doing research on the usability of a website she designed. She notices that a high percentage of users are clicking an action button, and rather than filling out the forms on the next page, they instead click their browser back button. She concludes that the labels and instructions on the form page must be poorly designed. What about her conclusion is flawed? 
	1. She is demonstrating the Spotlight effect.
	2. She is mistaking correlation for causation. (correct)
	3. She did not understand the user's purpose.
	4. She is doing problem space research when she should be doing solution space research. 
2. Match each item with the correct answer.
	1. Opportunity/Futures research 
		1. Problem space (correct)
		2. Solution space
	2. Studies focus on people with an existing relationship to your company or product.
		1. Problem space 
		2. Solution space (correct)
	3. Measured by metrics like KPI or OKR's.
		1. Problem space 	
		2. Solution space (correct)
	4. Starts with a hypothesis and moves to experiments.
		1. Problem space 
		2. Solution space (correct)
	5. Helpful for discovering people's inner thinking and purposes. 
		1. Problem space (correct)
		2. Solution space
3. People's purposes exist independent of a particular solution.
	1. True (correct)
	2. False
4. Choose the correct statement. 
	1. Problem space research results in cognitive empathy and a deeper understanding of a person's purpose with regards to the problem. 
	2. A good way to frame a purpose is to think about how someone who lived 100 years ago achieved the same outcome. 
	3. To understand a person's purpose, you should talk to people who have done considerable thinking around the purpose you are interested in. 
	4. All are true. (correct)
