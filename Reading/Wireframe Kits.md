A wireframe kit is a collection of components and patterns that can be combined to create wireframe screens. Because they consist of premade elements, they cut down on the time and effort it would take to design elements from scratch. They also help to establish visual cohesiveness by standardizing color usage, sizing, and overall visual aesthetics. This makes it quicker and easier to collaborate on wireframes while ensuring visual consistency.

More and more designers and design software and tools, such as [Sketch](https://www.sketchappsources.com/category/wireframe.html) and [Figma](https://www.figma.com/templates/wireframe-kits/), are making wireframe kits available for free download and usage. There’s a variety of options available, ranging in levels of fidelity, ease of use, and the quality of the kit itself. You’ll find that some kits are extremely robust and make it easy for customization, while other kits are overly simplistic or even include outdated elements. When searching for an appropriate kit for your project, make sure to do some research and don’t just go along with the first kit you find.

Remember that no matter how much research you put into finding a suitable wireframe kit, you’ll inevitably need to edit or expand on it. Often, you won’t know how you’ll need to add to it until after using it. A typical scenario is finding that the kit doesn’t include all of the components you end up needing. In these cases, you have a few options. You may create a new component by combining a few of the elements included in the kit. For example, you could design a form from a combination of input fields, buttons, and text. Or, you can follow the standardized styling of the kit to create new elements. Either way, the wireframe kit provides a starting point, making it easier and quicker to do.
