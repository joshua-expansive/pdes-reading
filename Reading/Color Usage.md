# Color Usage
In addition to evoking emotion, color can also communicate hierarchy and importance of content, points of interaction, and relationships of elements. Imagine a website that you visit frequently. Imagine that website is stripped of all color and replaced with a grayscale version of its typical color scheme. It would not only have a very different tone and emotion, but it might also be a little less intuitive to use, even for someone who visits it quite often. While you shouldn’t rely solely on color as the primary form of user guidance, it’s important to understand how to use color effectively to enhance the overall user experience. 

## Contrast and Visual Weight
Good use of contrast ensures that text is legible and that key elements are emphasized. Complementary colors of equal saturation and brightness will compete for attention when seen close to one another. It’s best to use high-contrast colors for essential elements, such as call-to-action (CTAs) buttons, and lower contrast colors for elements that shouldn’t become a distraction to the user. This creates visual weight and hierarchy in the design and draws the user’s attention. Visual weight is often established based on hue and saturation of the color, with more vibrant colors tending to draw the eye more immediately.

## Relativity
How we perceive color is highly dependent on the environment and surrounding elements. You might notice that the same color looks completely different when paired with colors or when used in varying weights and thicknesses.

## Space and Depth
Colors can also communicate space and the perception of depth, even on a flat design. An example of this is receding and advancing colors. Warm and bright colors can give the illusion of being closer to the viewer (advancing), while cool and dull colors appear to be further away (receding).

## Consistency 
Consistency of color usage is important in setting reliable expectations for users. If you’re using the same color to convey both error messages and success messages, it may cause confusion for your users. Alternatively, using colors consistently throughout a user experience can create quicker understanding. For example, if you use the same color for calls-to-action buttons (CTAs) on a web page, your users will begin to associate that color with points of interaction, making it easier for them to navigate and use your product.
