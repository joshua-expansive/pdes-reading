# Writing Good Scenarios and Testing Scripts

## Task scenarios that engage users

The essence of usability testing is understanding what works and doesn’t in a designed interface by watching people use it. You can gain qualitative insights into where the user struggles so that you can improve the design. To do this successfully, you need to create tasks with good scenarios. These task scenarios need to be realistic, encourage an action, and not give away how to use the interface.

First, ensure you have a list of general user goals that users of your product or service may have. These goals should include the most important things the user must be able to accomplish

Once you’ve figured out what the users’ goals are, you need to formulate task scenarios appropriate for usability testing. Next, you must provide some context for the user to imagine why and where they perform the task or activity as they interact with your product. This context would be your task scenario.

 **A task scenario is the action that you ask the participant to take on the tested interface.**

**Scenario:**
> You’re planning a vacation to New York City, March 3 − March 14. You need to buy both airfare and hotel. 

**Task:**
>Go to the American Airlines site and JetBlue Airlines site and see who has the best deals.

Writing good tasks will ensure that you are not testing the user to follow directions but instead focus on how the user interacts with your feature or product. To do this, you must ensure the following:

### Make the Task Realistic

Don’t force participants to act in a way that isn’t natural or engaging for them. Follow their thought process and criteria. If the user doesn’t have the freedom to interact, they may not own the task.

You can also allow participants to define their tasks if they follow their thought processes and behavior. Ideally, you’d observe them in their environment, but that is usually time-consuming and expensive.


### Make the task actionable and don’t give clues

The task shouldn’t ask the users to describe what they would do, so they answer in words. Instead, the task should encourage users to act/interact to reach the goal you set for them.

Avoid giving directions and step-by-step guidance when providing a task. They often provide clues on what to do vs. assessing whether they found the path to completing the task.

> **User Goal:** Find an event and check timings
**Poor Task:** You want to buy tickets to the museum exhibit on Sunday afternoon. Go to moma.com, click on events, and find the museum exhibit that is live on Sunday afternoon
**Better Task:** Go to Moma.com and find an event you’d like to take your friend to on Sunday
