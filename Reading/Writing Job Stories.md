# Writing Job Stories

A crucial aspect of modern Agile software development is the ability to break down work into individual units. Product managers sometimes write **user stories** which are short descriptions of functionality written from the user's perspective: As a (user), I can (capability) so that (benefit). One critique of user stories is that they are typically derived from the capability being built, not from observed user behavior. Job stories do a better job contextualizing the user need. 

```ad-note 
**Job stories were developed by the team at Intercom. **
“We frame every design problem in a Job, focusing on the triggering event or situation, the motivation and goal, and the intended outcome.” Paul Adams, “The Dribbblisation of Design,” Inside Intercom (blog), September 2013.
```

Writing job stories is easier if you've researched and defined all the stages and steps of the core job on a job map. One feature might have three to eight different job stories, and an entire product could have hundreds. It's not necessary to write all the job stories at once, only when a job step or sub-job is ready to be developed. 

There are variations of the job story format, but the one we recommend is by Jim Kalbach, author of the Jobs to Be Done Playbook: `When I [circumstance + job stage/step], I want to [micro-job], so I can [need]`. He offers these examples of job stories. 
> - When I am one of the top posters while updating my social media feeds daily, I want it to show on my profile so that I can increase recognition as an expert on the subject.
> - When I run out of materials needed while completing an art project, I want to find alternative materials so that I can maximize the number of uses of my current supplies.
> - When preparing for my commute and running late, I want to know the current weather along my journey so that I can minimize the chance of arriving wet.

Let's break down his last example. The job performer "commuter" is trying to do the core job "commute to work" and finds themselves in the the circumstance/context "running late." The job stage/step is "When preparing for my commute" and within that stage is a micro-job "check forecast." Notice that the statement does not contain any reference to a solution or technology. This same job story could easily apply to someone 20 or even 50 years ago. The need comes from an outcome statement on a job map, "minimize the chance of arriving to work wet."

**Take a few minutes now and practice breaking down the first two examples in a similar manner. **

Remember, job stories, just like everything in JTBD, come from research: interviews, observations, focus groups. While each job story is fictional, it is based on an insight that comes from user research.
