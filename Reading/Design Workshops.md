# Design Workshops

While presentations are opportunities to tell stories, meetings are opportunities to design experiences. It often falls to the designer to brainstorm ways to make meetings feel more engaging, interactive, and memorable, especially when working with clients. An excellent way to do this is by facilitating workshop activities with clients and stakeholders, creating more moments of collaboration, alignment, and visibility within a project. Whether your client is a developer, a marketing maven, or a financial backer, their insights and buy-in are invaluable to the platform’s success. Making clients active participants in the design process will allow you to understand business needs and constraints better to design the most viable product solution.
### Selecting Design Activities
Most design activities can be adapted and geared towards clients and stakeholders, so you’ll find many options available to you. When planning to workshop with clients and stakeholders, remember that your goals will nearly always center around gaining understanding and clarity or building alignment and buy-in. When selecting and planning a workshop activity, the best first step is to determine your goals. What do you want to learn and/or leave the touchpoint with? Do you need to know more about prioritizing existing product features? Do you want to gauge their current understanding of the user experience?

Most design methods and deliverables can be adapted into workshop activities. Here’s a list of some familiar and new activities that you can leverage when working with clients:
