# Marketing and Proto Personas

Up until this point, we’ve talked a lot about traditional design personas that are detailed depictions of the target audience, typically based on an extensive amount of research. However, these are not the only types of personas that you may encounter or even leverage.

## Marketing personas
Also known as buyer personas, marketing personas focus primarily on demographic information and behaviors that guide marketing decisions, such as shopping and purchasing preferences, motivations, and frustrations. They’re helpful when determining the best way to appeal to customers through messaging and social ads. However, they do not help with defining and prioritizing product/service features.

## Proto-personas
Also known as provisional personas or lean personas, proto-personas are the low-fidelity version of traditional personas. Unlike traditional personas, they’re created based on team and stakeholder assumptions and secondary research, such as web analytics, market research, and competitive analysis. This makes them a good option when the time or resources needed to conduct extensive user research are lacking. In these cases, they’ll serve as placeholders until enough user data is collected to create more formalized, traditional personas. 

Proto-personas also helpful to:
- Gather and align team and stakeholder assumptions of the target audience
- Identify current knowledge gaps of the target audience
- Identify user research needs and initiatives
- Produce a tangible summary of existing knowledge to compare against collected research

While traditional personas take the form of a polished deliverable, proto-personas are typically very simple, possibly even a quick sketch or doodle. Visually portraying them in a lower fidelity can help to emphasize that it’s a work in progress.
