# How to Write a Problem Statement

Problem statements come in a variety of forms, but the goal remains the same: to communicate a specific, research-driven, and actionable problem. It’s up to you to figure out the most impactful way to present and frame the design problem, based on the needs of your team and project. For now, we’ll review a simplified structure that mirrors the template-like style of [MadLibs.](http://www.madlibs.com/) This structure incorporates three key elements: the user, the user’s need, and a relevant insight.

> [User] needs [need] because, or in order to [insight or goal].

This structure answers some fundamental questions.

**Who are you solving for?** The user is identified through research. Be as specific as possible, as this is an opportunity to align stakeholders and team members on who exactly it is that you’re designing for.
    
**What are you solving?** The need is a user need, challenge, or issue rooted in research and that you plan to address. This should reflect the synthesis of many user touchpoints and should not be based on just a handful of users. Avoid framing the need as a solution, such as specific product features. (tip: needs are often verbs, whereas solutions are often nouns.)
    
**Why are you solving it?** The relevant insight typically articulates why the need is important to the user or the result of meeting the specified need. Leverage this as an opportunity to build empathy for the user by highlighting what you learned about them through research (i.e., motivations, challenges, etc.)

## How to refine a problem statement
For each problem statement, you’re trying to find the balance between being broad enough that there’s ample room for creative exploration while also providing enough specificity that it establishes a clear direction and shared understanding. This balance can be challenging to find, and it might take a few iterations to get there. The [Five Whys technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys) is a question-based strategy of reviewing your problem statement to make it more specific, focused, and concise. It involves asking “why” 5 times until you get to the root cause.

### Initial problem statement
> [Individuals with small amounts of disposable income] need [investment information] because [it can be confusing].
1.  **Why focus on this user type?** Because they’re interested in investing.    
2.  **Why do they need this?** Because investment information is difficult to find.
3.  **Why is it difficult to find?** Because it’s unclear what sources of information are credible or not.
4.  **Why do they need to find credible information?** Because their goal is to determine businesses that are worth investing their money in.
5.  **Why is this currently a struggle?** Because traditional investments are intimidating and impersonal to beginners.
    

### Revised Problem Statement
> [Potential investors with small amounts of disposable income] need [a way to access credible investment information easily and to discover businesses worth investing in] because [traditional investments can be intimidating and impersonal to those just starting out]. 

In this example, after further analysis, the identified problem has become much more specific. Now, looking back at the initial problem statement, it’s easy to see how it could be misunderstood by stakeholders or team members who weren’t directly involved in defining it. The revised problem statement provides a much more precise direction around who you’re designing for, what the need is, and why it’s essential. 

Keep in mind that this process of digging deeper to get to the root cause should be grounded in research and not assumptions. Also, make sure to avoid coming up with solutions to answer the why questions.
