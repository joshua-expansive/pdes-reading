The core values for UX-driven product design include empathy, ethics, and usability, with the overall goal to enhance user satisfaction. However, to get a seat at the table with the CEOs, product managers, and other top-level executives, you must consider why they hired you.

The value a product designer brings to the business is easily quantifiable with the help of metrics like conversion rates, retention rates, or improving brand perception and whatever else would help the company grow. Another consideration for the business is the tech restraints from the development team and budget and time.
## Finding the right balance
A simple & straightforward price comparison page would most likely save time and unnecessary headaches to the user and increase the conversion rate. In this example, the user needs and business needs align perfectly, and everybody wins.

However, sometimes it's not as simple. You have the find the right balance between advocating for the user while seeking long-term business gains. For example, a user's goal may be to cancel a subscription easily. However, this may negatively affect retention rates for the business and cost them a lot.

A seasoned product designer needs to make it easy enough for users to cancel the subscription while still aiming to maximize the number of users who willingly choose to stay. Designers should make assumptions on how both business and the user experience might get affected and back it by relevant research.
## Educate and communicate
As you gain a seat at the table and the business trusts you to make impactful changes, you must remember your ethical obligations and your responsibility towards your user. As an advocate for the user, you can continue to drive value and make meaningful change. Another part of your role as a product designer is educating and communicating the importance of user-centric design decisions. If you feel constantly pressured to design things that are not compliant with your values, or industry values, consider questioning whether the job is the right fit for you.
