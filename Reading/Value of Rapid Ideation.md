# Value of Rapid Ideation
The purpose of **rapid ideation** is to produce an abundance of ideas in a short amount of time unconstrained by judgements or perceived limitations. **Rapid ideation** promotes out-of-the-box thinking and creativity, and can lead to highly innovative and perhaps unanticipated solutions to complex problems.

The reason why traditional brainstorm sessions often feel lackluster is that many times there isn’t a clear or consistent format for doing generative thinking. That’s further compounded by the natural social dynamics of the people in the room. The best ideas may never see the light of day if the person who has them isn’t able to command enough respect or air time to have them heard or considered in the first place. Using a clear divergent > convergent structure keeps the playing field even for everyone in the room while enabling the group to generate a wider range of ideas and solutions that can turn into actionable outputs quicker.

The more ideas and solutions we generate, the better chance we have of seeing our highest-impact ones make it to market.

Ideas can often grow exponentially — especially if the participants are encouraged to think quickly without fear of judgment. Rapid ideation uses the power of groups to create a volume of new ideas/solutions to evaluate shortly thereafter.
