# The JTBD Framework
## Background
Jobs to Be Done (JTBD) is a popular framework with product managers who use it to plan and execute roadmaps, often quarterly. It was invented by [Clayton Christensen](https://claytonchristensen.com/biography/), an innovation thought leader. Its benefit lies in giving teams a shared unit of analysis and a common language to talk about value to the user. It has become an increasingly utilized tool in software development in companies such as [Intercom](https://www.intercom.com/resources/books/intercom-jobs-to-be-done) and [Mural](https://www.mural.co/blog/jtbd).

> When we were first introduced to Jobs-to-be-Done, it quickly resonated with something we already intuitively knew—that great products were built around solving problems. What Jobs-to-be-Done gave us was a better way of framing what we felt—a vocabulary and framework to unite the team behind a product strategy. Over time, it turns out it’s not just a great way of thinking about a product. It’s become a marketing strategy at Intercom and informing research, sales, and support.

## Components of Jobs to be Done
Everything in the JTBD framework comes from or is informed by research. JTBD is all about understanding and designing for customer needs while considering who, what, how, why, and when/where. 
1. Job statements
2. Job performer
3. Outcome statements
4. Job Map or Process

### Jobs are what the user wants to accomplish.
1. A job is stable and does not change over time. 
2. Jobs don't have geographical boundaries. 
3. A job is solution agnostic. 

**Core jobs** are the overarching aim of the user. All other jobs are defined relative to the Core job. “Get my groceries for the week” or “Decide what school my child will attend” are examples of core jobs. 

**Related jobs** help you understand other objectives that might support the main job. “Buy only organic, local fruits and vegetables” is a related job to the grocery example. “Feel like my child is safe while at school” is a related emotional job to the school example. 

**Emotional jobs** define how customers want to feel or avoid feeling as a result of executing the core functional job.

**Social jobs** define how the customer wants to be perceived by others.

### The job performer is who executes the job.
Goal-based personas are particularly valuable because they focus on behavior patterns in the problem space, not the solution itself. 

### Outcomes are how the user measures success.
A customer's desired outcomes don't change over time, only the solutions do. This is part of why JTBD can be such a useful framework. Outcomes answer the question: Why does the performer strive to complete the job? 

### The job map is the artifact that shows all the steps in getting a job done from the customer’s perspective. 
A job map is different from a customer journey map in that it documents the user’s needs and behaviors in a way that does not include your existing (or future) solution. A job map visualizes a linear sequence of discrete stages consisting of smaller goals as the customer progresses toward the main goal, the core functional job. It doesn't show what the customer *is* doing (solution space), it visualizes what the customer is trying to get done (problem space). The job map is focused on the underlying goals of the actions being taken. Because of that focus, the job description must be independent of any and all competing solutions the customer is using. It is the ideal process flow for that job, including all the steps in the right order for job completion or attainment.

Jobs to Be Done is a comprehensive product development framework that can define a company's  strategy and  roadmap for a year. There are several other parts of JTBD that we won't go into during this course. We have selected the methods from JTBD that a product designer is most likely to use and benefit from.
