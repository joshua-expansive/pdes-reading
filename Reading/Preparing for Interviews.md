# Preparing for Interviews
How do you know what questions will gain the information you need? How do you make sure the questions aren't biased, so the data isn't compromised? How do you get accurate and actionable information about user behavior and attitudes? 

The questions you decide to ask and how you ask them significantly impact the quality of data you will get from user interviews.

## 1. Establish the goals
A clear understanding of the research goals and objectives is a necessary prerequisite to writing the interview script. The research goals inform the adoption of appropriate methods and tools. In the same way, your research goals act as a guide to writing interview questions. 

## 2. Create an interview script
The interview script should have:
1. A scripted opening that gives context to the interview. You can seek approval for data gathering or recording here and provide the participant a chance to ask questions. If you intend to collect any demographic data, write those questions in the opening too.
2. The interview questions. Keep your questions clear and concise. Make every effort to write high-quality interview questions. [12 Ways to Improve User Interview Questions](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/06/user-interview-questions/) talks about six common pitfalls and six ways to improve your question writing. A good exercise is to read your questions aloud to someone and check that they are easy to answer.
3. A scripted closing (optional).
    
## 3. Plan the interview logistics	
Being familiar with your tools, the physical location, and the interview's intended structure will help you relax and pay better attention. There are several things you need to decide before the interview. 

**How will you record the interview?** If you use your phone to record, turn off notifications, put it on silent, make sure it's charged. 

**Will you need to transcribe the interview?** While there are benefits to transcribing by hand, it is a long process. Special transcription services are more accurate but can be costly. There are [apps and software programs](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS912US915&ei=N-r1X6vsMZGwsAXZ0a-4Ag&q=+Voice+transcription&oq=+Voice+transcription&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzICCAAyAggAMgIIADIGCAAQBxAeMgYIABAHEB4yAggAMgIIADICCAAyBggAEAcQHjICCAA6BAgAEEc6BQgAEM0COggIABAIEAcQHjoICAAQBxAFEB46CAgAEAcQChAeUJg8WM1SYIBVaABwA3gAgAGAAYgB6guSAQM5LjaYAQCgAQKgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6yAEIwAEB&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwjr44jp4YfuAhURGKwKHdnoCycQ4dUDCA0&uact=5) that will give you a decent transcript, but they can be messy and often require additional formatting by hand. 

**How will you take notes if recording the interview isn't an option?** Typing notes on a laptop can sometimes be distracting. You want all your focus on the participant, not your computer screen. It's tempting to take exhaustive notes, typing quotes verbatim. Embracing the constraint of pen and paper alleviates the need to capture everything (since you can't write that fast), and it will help you develop a shorthand style during interviews. Aim for taking [descriptive notes](https://condens.io/user-research-note-taking/), rather than inferential or evaluative. It would be best to document what you hear and see instead of your judgments about what you hear and see. Having a person taking notes for you could be a good option if the resource is available.
    
## 4. Review the Research Plan and Script
If you know your research questions solidly, you will ask better follow-up questions during the interview. You will know what lines of conversation are productive and which ones are not.

Some interviewers read the questions directly from the script until they've gained more experience conducting interviews. Reading the questions reduces the chance that they will sound confusing or biased to the participant.
