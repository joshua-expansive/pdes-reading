# Research Guides

## Why you need a research guide
We use research guides (also called research plans) whenever we conduct any type of data gathering. With a goal-directed research guide, you will generate better insights which lead to better decision-making. Research guides can be adapted depending on the size, budget, and timeline of the project, but the essential reason for having one is the same. Some research plans are 20 pages, and others, a single page. If your research timeline is short, scoped to one method, or only needs a few sessions, then a one page planning document is probably sufficient. 

### Research guides help you think through the best approach
We owe it to our stakeholders to make sure we are making the best use of their budget. By following a systematic process, you can collect data in the most mindful way. 

### Research guides help you define what questions matter
The fastest way to make your research count is to make sure you are answering the questions that people care about. By interviewing stakeholders, you get a sense of what matters to them. Not all stakeholders are practiced at describing project goals as appropriate research questions, so designers must sometimes re-frame stakeholder insights as research questions. 

### Research guides help you remember that other people have a stake in research outcomes
Sharing your research plans with stakeholders is one way to keep them engaged. It also creates transparency and allows other disciplines to better understand the process you are following. Inevitably, your research will have an impact on people, so it's important to keep them involved. 

### Research guides help you name your assumptions
Once you've identified the most important research questions, it's a good idea to document your assumptions. What are some things you anticipate finding out, given what you already know? Another reason to document assumptions is you will be more apt to recognize them as such during things like user interviews. If you find yourself nudging the participant toward a particular answer it might be because you have some assumptions about the solution or what is "correct." 

## Parts of a research guide
A research planning document should be succinct, direct, and as clear as possible. Write the plan as if someone else will execute it, as is sometimes the case. 

### Title and Date
- Update the date with the last time the document was edited.

### Author and Stakeholders
- By including stakeholders names you keep them engaged and part of the process.
