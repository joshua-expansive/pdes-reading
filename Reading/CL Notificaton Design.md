A notification system is so much part of a digital product’s UX that without it, the product would feel as if something was left out. If there is no “visibility of system status” and feedback, it is akin to driving a car without a dashboard.

A car’s dashboard is full of gauges, icons, and lights designed to provide visibility into the car’s operating system and ensure safe and reliable operability. When we drive, a cluster of readouts and notifications about engine temperature, battery health, oil pressure, lights, brakes, airbags, and so on keep us informed. When we want to make a turn, there is a blinking light for the turn signal, along with a clicking sound, both providing us with feedback. We also have a fuel tank gauge that indicates when the fuel tank is low.
