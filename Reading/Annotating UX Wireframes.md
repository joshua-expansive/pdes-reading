# Annotating UX Wireframes
Like any diagram or design artifact, wireframes do not stand on their own. There are detailed behaviors and functions that would be burdensome and finicky to represent on every screen. Annotations can communicate contextually important or elaborate details that would be difficult to represent visually. 

```ad-note
Write annotations so that anyone could take your wireframes and build it without needing to speak with you. 
```

## Identify the audience
The first question you should ask before annotating is: **"who is my audience"**? You should be as familiar as possible with the types of questions your audience will have. If they have a lot context for the project, then establishing background and contextual reasoning for each screen might be unnecessary. On the other hand, if the bulk of the information is new, you may need to spend more time writing context for your decisions. Keep in mind, different roles will have different questions. If you are annotating for an audience made up of several roles, you will need to call out the specific role in the annotation.

## Be brief
Get your audience to the information they need as easily and quickly as possible. So **keep annotations short and to the point**.  If your wireframes are clear, focused, and designed with the end audience in mind, the wireframes may not need heavy annotation. 
- Avoid design jargon
- Use active voice for clarity
- Use simple vocabulary
- Avoid redundancies  

## What to annotate
Write a list of scenarios that are important for the audience and project. Ask: *When will annotations be useful and for who?* Here are a few examples, but you should make your own list so you are consistent across every screen. 
- State changes
- Error states and edge cases
- Accessibility requirements
- Interactivity and gestures
- Hidden content (e.g. dropdown menu, tooltip, modal)
- Constraints and conditional paths
- Background research for design decisions
- Links to additional documentation (design system, research, prototypes)
- Call to actions
- Dynamic elements
- Messaging and prompts
