# Narrating a Case Study
Your portfolio tells a story about you and your career, and your case studies are about your work and ability to design.

Each case study section is like a minor case study in itself—the challenge, the approach, the solution, the result. The result of one section feeds directly into the challenge of the next. When you follow this structure, you demonstrate what hiring managers want to see most: The combination of problem-solving, analytical skills, and your ability to design.

Writing about your design process for an audience is different than doing the actual design work. Creating a good case study requires:
- Good design work
- Appropriately displaying that work for viewing online.
- Contextualizing your work.
- Creating a narrative that speaks to why you made those artifacts.
- Speaking to outcomes and impact

## Tell a story, concisely
A good case study is focused and engaging. You can tell a story in many ways, but what makes a memorable one is its focus on the exciting and most impactful parts. Like a joke, do some setup and then deliver a punch-line, so people are left entertained. 

Your first draft may be quite long. To keep your case study concise, iterate your story and eliminate any details that do not strengthen the core narrative.

## The structure of a case study
These sections provide a foundation for you to build on. But every project is unique, and you should write about your work in the way that tells the best narrative. 
-   If you find yourself discussing problems, they must lead to solutions.
-   If you discuss deliverables, talk about the strategy and thinking. 
-   There’s always a before and after to each step.
-   Keep pacing in mind and balance out the sections. 

### Challenge (Problem) 
Describe the challenge or scope of the project provided either by the client or the project brief. If the challenge shifted during the project, write about the research and strategy contributing to that decision. 

### Approach (Process and Methods) 
Outline your approach to the project challenges but keep this section of your case study light. Don’t write anything that attempts to explain a fundamental element of the design process. Unless it’s a highly unusual part of the process, it’s safe to assume the reader’s already familiar with it. Hiring managers have expressed that because most techniques and methods haven’t shifted over time, explaining the process and methodologies is not a fruitful use of time or real estate for case studies. Touch on the design approach quickly, but move on to the meat (discoveries and solutions) of your case study.

### Discoveries (User Insights)
If applicable, after you discuss the testing and research in your approach section, highlight the insights gained during the project. Was there something surprising that arose that shifted the project? Was there a new layer of information that provided additional insight on the project challenges? 

### Solutions (Design Decisions, Strategy, and Deliverables)
Show how research findings and synthesis allowed you to follow a strategy to get to the final solution. This is a critical piece of making you and your case study stand out. This is where you show your skills and abilities in thinking, problem-solving, and developing solutions. 

When we talk about the “design process,” it does not just mean the steps you took on a project. It’s **why** you took those steps. This is the difference between designing solutions and being procedural. The reasoning for each design decision must always be clear. 
- It was a step that you decided to take, after much research
- It was the best possible option out of multiple options
- It was part of keeping the client’s competitive differentiation
- It was done with the user in mind
- It was a recommendation from the creative director or client

### Outcomes (Results)
If applicable, talk about how the design solution changed the business or user experience. If there is data to back up the statements, even better. Discuss answers to questions like: 
-   How did the project help the business?
-   How did the project help the user?
-   What metrics are worth noting?

## A Good Medium for Case Studies
As [Medium.com](https://medium.com/) has become a staple in our modern-day digital content sharing, there has been a noticeable increase of case studies being shared by individual designers and organizations. Medium is a good home for case studies to provide a linear storyline and native visual design options. Large bleeding images, sizable headers, distinctive subheaders, inline images with captions, pull-out quotes, highlights, and more are all built into the format of Medium articles, providing the visual interest touted as successful storytelling and showcasing of design projects. And even better, Medium provides an estimated read time, giving hiring managers a good idea of how long your case study will take to review. If you decide this is a good option for your case study, ensure you are still creating the “gated” overview of your project in your portfolio before you link out to the Medium case study.
