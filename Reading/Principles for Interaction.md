# Principles for Interaction
Don Norman is best known for his books on design, especially [The Design of Everyday Things](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=the+design+of+everyday+things&crid=2GVVRKRFL12L3&sprefix=the+design+of+every,aps,169&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_1_19). He is widely regarded for his expertise in the fields of design, usability engineering, and cognitive science. He is also a co-founder and consultant with the [Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com).

## 1) What it does, 2) how it works, and 3) what operations are possible
For someone to successfully use our designs, the three items above must be 'discoverable.' **Discoverability** depends on the correct application of five psychological principles. 
### Signifiers 
 **Signifier**: any mark or sound, any perceivable indicator that communicates appropriate behavior to a person.
> Affordances define what actions are possible. Signifiers specify how people discover those possibilities: signifiers are signs, perceptible signals of what can be done. —Don Norman (Norman, 2013)

**Signifiers** and **affordances** work together. For people to know how to interact with a given affordance, there must be clues about what to do—the signifier is the clue. It communicates what actions are possible. People search for clues, meaningful information to help them understand how to interact with our designs. It is a designer's job to include signifiers for any affordances in their designs. This includes communicating the purpose, structure, and operation of the software to the person using it. 
### Feedback
Feedback is sending back information about what action is done and what is accomplished, allowing the person to continue with the activity. Various kinds of feedback are available for interaction design-audio, tactile, verbal, and combinations of these. It's easier for users to determine their next action when they are confident in the state of the system. Useful and timely feedback builds trust in a product and brand over time.

### Constraints
Constraints are ways of keeping users from making errors; either they do something other than what they intended, or their goal was inappropriate for the current task. Helpful constraints are:
- disabled states on interactive elements when taking an action would result in an error
- good defaults and placeholder text in form fields to prevent typos or the wrong format, i.e restricting a time input field to numbers
### Mapping
Mapping refers to the relationship between a control and its effect in the real world. Inputs like up and down arrows and scroll bars are examples of an accurate relationship between the control and the output. Note that mapping depends on a user's mental model. In the example below, Logitech gives the option to change the scrolling behavior of the mouse wheel so the scrolling inverts. Some users prefer natural scrolling direction and some like the standard version.

###### The Logitech MX3 lets you map its behavior (output) according to your mental models of scrolling, pointing, and clicking. This demonstrates [two other principles](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/): giving users control and freedom and flexibility and efficiency of use. 
### Consistency and Standards 
If a user has to find a new way to resolve a similar kind of problem while interacting with a design, they will get frustrated and confused. Devices, OS's, platforms, and industry's all have standard conventions when it comes to user experience, interaction and visual design. Following these conventions whenever possible helps users do what they need to do with your designs. Breaking these standards, or introducing new ones, increases people's cognitive load, at least until they internalize the new mental model. So it should only be done intentionally and with proper research and testing.
