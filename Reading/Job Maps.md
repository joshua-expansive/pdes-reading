# Job Maps
## The role of the job map in product development
Job maps represent the long-term strategy and vision of a business. Once a job map is finished, you should be able to see deficiencies in the current product or solution. It might be that a certain customer segment has been overlooked, or the product only gets the customer 70% to completing their job. 

By mapping everything out, a team is able to prioritize the essential jobs and then think through what must be done to support those jobs. By putting it all in one place, the team can find unmet needs and diverge on solutions to address them. The map also gives teams a way to compare competing solutions.

## The stages of a job map
A job is composed of a sequence of chronological stages. These are smaller jobs within the main job and make up a beginning, middle, and end. The stages of the main job “Go on vacation” might be: 
-   Beginning
	-   Plan	
    -   Select
    -   Prepare 
-   Middle 
	-   Begin vacation
	-   Make memories
    -   End vacation
-   End
	-   Return
	-   Reflect
	-   Share
### Each stage breaks down into steps
Within each stage are discrete steps, the smallest unit in the framework. If we add steps to the Beginning stage, it might look like this:
-   Beginning
	-   Plan
		-   Budget
		-   Find dates
		-   Explore vacation packages
	-   Select	
		-   Determine package
		-   Share package information
	-   Prepare 
		-   Arrange pickup to travel to the airport
		-   Arrive and board
