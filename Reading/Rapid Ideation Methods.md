# Rapid Ideation Methods
Ideation is often referred to synonymously with the term ‘brainstorm”, but brainstorming is just one type of ideation method. There are hundreds of ideation methods and techniques available, and the preferred ones will vary from organization to organization and from team to team. Designers should prepare to be flexible in their approach to ideation methods and ready to adapt them to best suit the needs of the current project and the team.

6-8-5s, also known as Crazy 8s, is a rapid ideation process that repeatedly iterates and expands on ideas to think more outside the box. This technique has become very popular and most common for rapid ideation because of its efficiency. It encourages you to ask non-designers to contribute to the ideation process when done as a group.

#### These are the general steps
1. Fold a page in half three times, creating eight boxes.
2. Set a timer for eight minutes
3. Each person now has eight minutes to draw eight different ideas — that’s one minute per idea, and it goes quicker than you expect!
4. If done as a group, each person gets 2 minutes to talk about their ideas, and you then do multiple rounds of iterations. 
5. Begin to shorten the number of sketches during each round to make converging ideas easier, i.e., in the second round, only sketch four ideas. Then if you do the third round, you can narrow it down even more and only sketch your best one or two ideas.

## Negative brainstorming
This method encourages you to explore new solutions through **negative thinking**. The group tries to find the worst ideas and then transform them into useful ones. By flipping faulty solutions, you gain a new perspective on possible good ones

[Sample question](https://projectofhow.com/methods/negative-brainstorming/#:~:text=A%20method%20that%20use%20brainstorming,generate%20good%20solutions%20through%20brainstorming.):

_How could you make children and grandparents understand each other more?_

Bad ideas:
- Build a wall between old and young people.
- Place them in two different buildings, so they never meet. 
- Make a machine that distracts the youngsters, so they don’t want to spend time with the elders.

Transformed bad idea:
- Create a retirement home with a kindergarten in the middle. The elders could then come by and help when they have time.

## Mash-ups
Mash-ups is a fun thought exercise of narrowing in on a couple of qualities to emulate and then identifying businesses, brands, and services that embody each quality. Then, asking a question like, “What’s the bed and breakfast version of a hospital?” to spark innovation.

#### These are the general steps
1. Frame: Define the challenge as a How Might We statement.
2. Narrow: Pick two broad, unrelated categories, like hospitals and hotels or waiting rooms and schools. Think outside your industry.
3. Generate: Starting with one category at a time, list as many elements of these two experiences as you can in two minutes.
4. Mash-up: Combine items from the two lists to ideate as many new products, services, or experiences as you can.

Mash-ups work best when done in quantity. The more ideas you develop, the better chance you have to reach a great solution. This ideation process takes a little longer than Crazy 8s but works especially well when needing out-of-the-box ideas.
