# Habit-Forming Design
Successful, compelling products not only serve users but keep them coming back for more. Apple, Facebook, Google, Twitter, Pinterest are examples of products that users get used to and keep them coming back. Better yet, they become a part of their day-to-day and integrate into their lives vs. disrupt them.

High-growth or high-engagement, on their own, are not enough to make a successful product. Businesses need to master behavior design to keep users engaged long enough to form new habits. However, consider what habits you are trying to change with your product or service and what benefit this provides the user.
## Things to consider
### New behaviors must be pleasurable, not forced.
To encourage the behavior to become a habit, think about your product or service and ask yourself if you are helping users do something they want to do for the pleasure of it? How might you inject more fun into your design?
### Distinguish between frequent and infrequent habits.
Ask if your company or business depends on users coming back on their own, or can you use other methods to drive engagement? Think about whether your business model necessitates forming habits? If your product isn't used frequently (at least once a week), it won't become a habit. All products cannot convert usage into habits. 
### Increase customer engagement with content and community.
When you cannot bring users back to your core product, you can often "attach" a habit to your product. Blogs and social communities ensure readers and commentors keep coming back and keep the brand in mind. The focus should be to provide compelling content for the user without forcing the action you want them to take.

Williams-Sonoma, the high-end cookware company, was struggling to get repeat customers. The team didn't know how to create a habit of buying high-end cookware. So, rather than wasting energy and resources trying to solve an unsolvable problem, Williams-Sonoma attached a habit to their product experience by developing their cooking website, Taste. Taste publishes recipes, product recommendations, and other cooking-related articles multiple times each day. Their content is fresh, social media-friendly, and frequent, all of the things needed to form a habit. Before long, people formed habits with Taste, which led to them becoming customers at Williams-Sonoma.

### Consider the moral implications of designing for habits.
Be mindful of addictive products and technology that become addictive and a detriment of the user's life.

1. **Phase 1: Trigger**
Habit-forming products could start by alerting users with external triggers like an email, a website link, or the app icon on the phone. 
2. **Phase 2: Action**
The ease of performing an action and the psychological motivation to do it encourages users to take action with the trigger.
3. **Phase 3: Variable Reward**
What distinguishes the Hook Model from a standard feedback loop is the hook's ability to create desire. Creating intrigue upon taking action by changing up the reward is what users start craving. When the brain is expecting a reward, there is a feel-good dopamine surge. Making the reward variable multiplies the effect.
4. **Phase 4: Investment**
The more time, data, effort, social capital, or money the user puts into the product keeps them coming back for more. This investment increases the odds that the user will make another pass through the hook cycle. By cycling through successive hooks, users begin to form associations with internal triggers, which attach to existing behaviors and emotions and become habits.

Barbra sees a photo in her Facebook newsfeed taken by a family member from a rural part of the state. It's a lovely picture, and since she is planning a trip there with her brother Johnny, the external trigger's call-to-action intrigues her, and she clicks. Over time, Barbra associates Facebook with her need for social connection.

The simple action of clicking on the interesting picture in her newsfeed takes Barbra to Pinterest, a "pinboard-style photo-sharing" site. Once Barbra completes the simple action of clicking on the photo, she is dazzled by what she sees next.

The images are related to what she is generally interested in â€” but other things catch her eye as well. The exciting juxtaposition of relevant and irrelevant, tantalizing and plain, beautiful and familiar, sets her brain's dopamine system aflutter with the promise of reward. Before she knows it, she's spent 45 minutes scrolling.

She slowly builds a desire to keep the things that delight her. By collecting items, she'll be giving the site data about her preferences. Soon she will follow, pin, re-pin, and make other investments, which will increase her ties to the site and prime her for future loops through the hook.
