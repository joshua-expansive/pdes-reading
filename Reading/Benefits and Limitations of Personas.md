Personas are realistic representations of different user types who exhibit similar needs, skills, experiences, behaviors, attitudes, and motivations. 

> “[Personas] only need to be realistic, not real, not necessarily even accurate, as long as they accurately characterize the user base.” -[Don Norman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Norman)

They are not actual descriptions of real individuals but rather a reliable portrayal of the target audience based on actual data collected through user research. A persona distills information sourced from many people and presents that information as a memorable character that can be easily referenced throughout the design process.

## Why do we use them?
Research doesn’t hold much value without insights. Insights need to be synthesized further, and one way to synthesize and communicate user needs, goals, and motivations is by making a persona.

Personas are vital to the success of a product because they drive design decisions by taking everyday user needs and bringing them to the forefront of planning before the design has started. Personas provide the team with a shared understanding of users in terms of goals and capabilities.

## Benefits and Limitations
Despite being developed a few decades ago, personas are still widely utilized today. Designers still use personas to illustrate certain trends and patterns of user data. They encourage teams to develop a more human-centered mindset by associating, sometimes literally, a face with the user experience, making user data feel more human, approachable, and memorable. Designers also rely on personas to:

- Communicate and share user research findings
- Build empathy and understanding of users
- Inform decisions and prioritize focus based on user data
- Recognize different user types with varying needs and motivations
- Gain alignment and consensus with other teams and stakeholders
- Avoid designing for yourself or other stakeholders who do not represent the actual users
    
However, personas have also garnered quite a bit of controversy over the years. It’s difficult to discuss using personas in the design industry without encountering conflicting opinions on best practices and even their general value. Being aware of personas’ potential limitations and downfalls will allow you to leverage them better. 

### They’re challenging to get right
Even a seasoned designer can have difficulty in developing a persona that people use and reference. It requires a lot of ongoing research and iteration, even beyond the initial persona development. As they gather new user insights, designers must constantly examine the relevance of personas throughout the design process.
    
### They’re not a replacement for user research
Some personas are made with little to no research, ultimately resulting in a presentation of unfounded insights. Personas must be created by synthesizing insights collected from actual users. Personas are only as good as the research supporting them.
    
### They can feel forced
It’s a common scenario where personas are developed within a silo and then presented as the source of truth for everyone to follow. To use personas, they must feel invested in them as a tool and resource. It’s ultimately unfair and potentially misleading to ask other team members to blindly rely on personas without building understanding and context of the research that went into it.
    
### They can result in misconceptions
Sometimes personas are more based on assumptions than research but still presented as the source of truth. This can result in significant decisions being made based on personal preferences and biases rather than accurate data. It’s important to recognize that a persona is not the actual user; it’s a simplified version of them with limitations to be conscious of.
    
### They’re viewed as an end goal
Because personas are still considered a staple in the design process, stakeholders may request one to be created for the sake of having one. Considering personas as just another deliverable to check off the list rather than an iterative process of user discovery can have significant negative outcomes, ultimately distracting from the actual goals and needs of the project. In these cases, it’s good to assess the situation to determine if a persona is appropriate. If all efforts to advocate in another direction fail, you might find yourself creating a persona that’s ultimately not that useful. In these cases, aim to establish a solid understanding of the potential shortcomings it may have.
    
At this point, you might be wondering whether personas are worth the trouble or not. Like most parts of the design process, it all depends on context. A good place to start is defining specific goals and needs to determine if it is or is not helpful and how to best leverage it. While personas can help to inform decisions, they’re just one piece of a larger puzzle. To think that personas can perfectly capture the complexity of a target audience would be too simple. Personas come with limitations and should always be leveraged in conjunction with various other tools, methods, and deliverables.
