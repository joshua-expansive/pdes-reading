# Sketching Techniques
Sketching is a communication tool, first and foremost. You do not have to master aesthetics to sketch well.


## Mastering basics

Fortunately, you only need to know how to draw the most basic UX/UI sketching shapes.

These are some commonly used shapes to indicate certain elements:

**A. Text lines:** Text lines could be squiggly, straight, or a combination of the two.

**B. Body of text:** Drawing multiple text lines in a group indicates a paragraph of text.

**C. Headings:** Headings could be written out in sketches. Other times, they are usually emphasized by bolder lines to indicate some hierarchy from the remaining copy/text

**D. Checklist:** by adding bullets by a bunch of text lines, you indicate a checklist.

**E. Images:** Indicate images by drawing a rectangle filled in with an “X”.

**F. Video player:** Draw a rectangle and put a small right-facing triangle in the middle to indicate a video player.

**G. User profile/avatar:** Draw the standard user icon to indicate a user profile or avatar.

**H. Form field:** a form field, AKA an input bar, is represented by a skinny horizontal rectangle.

**I. Button:** for a button, represent it as a rectangle, filled in or outlined. If left outlined, add a beveled shadow to make it look clickable.

**J. Search bar:** By adding a magnifying glass to a form field, you indicate a search bar

## Text and Annotations

Label and annotate your sketches if someone else will be looking at them.

-   Ensure your handwriting is legible.
-   Use real copy in the sketches where you want to draw the user’s attention and highlight.
-   Use language appropriate for the audience to your sketches, using shorthand only for internal teams and yourself.

## Tips and tricks
**Start simple:**
Sketch out the essential components of a wireframe before adding and exploring different ideas. (ex. buttons, navigation, etc.)

**Begin with the most important:**
The key is to start with the most critical function or component of your screen. This approach helps challenge and maintain hierarchy as you add other things on the page.

**Use Colors Intentionally:**
You could use colors to convey hierarchy in your notes by using highlighters. When the rest of the sketch is in black and white, colors become a great visual indication to users following your thought process.

**Maintain Consistency:**
Reduce cognitive load by repeating the same sketching components on each screen and maintaining consistency.
