# Scoping the Problem

**Problem statements are clear, actionable descriptions of the issues and/or challenges that need to be addressed, based on research and user insights.**

Defining the problem is one of the most crucial and complex steps of the design process, possibly even more so than solving the problem itself. When executed well, it becomes the north star of the design process, guiding design decisions and holding team members accountable. When executed poorly, it can lead a team astray, waste time and resources, and result in designs with little to no user value. Countless failed startups demonstrate how even a well-designed product or service will inevitably fail if it doesn’t define or solve the right problem.

Problems are defined through the process of analysis and synthesis. The analysis focuses on breaking down complex information into more manageable components, while synthesis focuses on piecing together information to form complete ideas. This creates a more detailed and holistic understanding and provides a more precise picture of the problem needing to be solved. This process typically occurs sometime after research and before ideation, but it’s good to revisit the problem throughout the design process as things progress and discoveries are made.

Problem statements, also known as point-of-view (POV) statements, are the articulated form of the problem you’re trying to solve for. They are straightforward, actionable descriptions of the issues and challenges that need to be addressed, based on research and user insights. They often express a point of view, highlight an unmet need or goal of the user, and identify a gap between the current state and the desired state of the design.

In addition to providing clarity and focus on the problem being solved, there are many added benefits of leveraging problem statements, such as:

-   **Collaboration:** Problem statements distill a potentially complex problem space into a more digestible form, making it easier to communicate and align with other team members and stakeholders in the project. They also make it easier to spark discussion and feedback since there’s a more tangible form to focus on.
    
-   **Accountability:** Throughout a project, problem statements help to prioritize efforts better and weigh options based on whether or not a potential solution addresses the primary issue(s) and need(s) identified. At the end of a project, they can act as a standard measure of success to assess whether the core problem has been addressed or not.
    
-   **Ideation:** Problem statements provide meaningful context and encourage action, helping to kickstart the ideation process. They help guide and focus the ideation process.

## Common Challenges
Problem statements provide meaningful context and encourage action, helping to kickstart, guide, and focus the ideation process. 

### Your problem statement is based on assumptions instead of research
Assumptions are a necessary part of the design process. They allow designers to form hypotheses that guide research and testing efforts. However, it’s essential to be aware of what is an assumption and what is a fact. Don’t be afraid to [challenge assumptions](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/learn-how-to-use-the-best-ideation-methods-challenge-assumptions), facts, and even user needs that aren’t supported by research. For example, you might find yourself working on a project where you inherit a problem statement. As much as possible, try to validate whether it is a problem, a symptom, or an assumption about the problem. Is the problem statement outdated or missing key findings? You might find that it is based on assumptions rather than actual data points. In this case, it might be helpful to establish an initial or assumptive problem statement to guide further research until you’re able to define a final problem statement. Just make sure that everyone involved knows that it’s based on assumptions and requires additional validation.

### Clear writing is hard
The main goal of the problem statement is to communicate the core problem based on your research. It should provide guidance and alignment for team members and stakeholders. Because of this, written communication skills are critical, and not everyone is highly proficient. What can you do if writing isn’t your strong point and you aren’t teamed up with a good writer? A good starting point is to remember that a problem statement is a deliverable and, like many other design deliverables, can and should be tested and validated. Get feedback from anyone involved in the project. Does their interpretation of your problem statement align with what you intended to communicate? Not only will you be able to pinpoint unclear and confusing points of your problem statement, but you might even gather feedback that can improve the focus of the problem itself.

### Your team disagrees on what the problem is
Each stakeholder and team member will have their own opinions and interpretation of the problem, and sometimes this can even cause disagreements amongst the team. While it’s crucial to gain buy-in from stakeholders and other team members, involving them shouldn’t become a blocker for the project. Collaborative synthesis sessions can still be productive. For example, a group may brainstorm potential problem statements, and a smaller subset of participants will synthesize the collected input. Then, time permitting, you might present the synthesized problem statement to the large group for feedback.

### Your problem statement addresses symptoms, not actual problems
It’s easy to mistake the symptoms caused by a problem for the problem itself. The problem statement should represent the root cause. Let’s say someone tells you that they have a sore throat and, after further inquiry, you realize that it’s because they have mono. While you could offer them a cough drop, that only solves for an immediate, short-term need, whereas recommending they see a doctor and get medicine would address the root cause and ultimately alleviate the sore throat (i.e., the symptom) as well. 

While solving for symptoms can still be helpful, your efforts won’t have a long-term and holistic impact on the core problem. As designers, it’s our job to dig deeper, keep asking questions, and challenge assumptions to uncover the root cause. The most impactful time to do this is during the research stages of the project. But it is healthy to revisit the validity and focus of your problem statement throughout a project. Further research and testing may expose that what you thought was a root problem was just a symptom, and that’s okay. Be prepared to be flexible.

### There are too many problems to address
Depending on the length of the project and the bandwidth of your team, you might consider establishing multiple problem statements. Possibly, you have a primary problem statement that you prioritize your efforts to tackle, but you also have a secondary problem statement that you’re always keeping in mind. You might identify that there’s a future problem that you currently don’t have the resources or ability to address, but it’s worth establishing to encourage your team to consider more long-term goals while you solve for a more attainable, current problem. Or, you might find that there are distinctly different problems depending on the type of user, in which case you might find it helpful to establish a problem statement per user type. 

Keep in mind that having multiple problem statements isn’t always the right solution. Adding more focuses into the mix can cause more confusion than add value. It might make more sense for your team and the project to narrow down and focus on one problem statement. In these cases, the best approach is to keep asking questions and digging deeper into research to challenge each problem statement’s assumptions. Based on what you learn, it might become obvious which problem statement to move forward with. You might also find that you need to combine, adapt, or completely start over to get to the most impactful problem statement.

### Your problem statement addresses a user want instead of a user need.
As you assess research and user insights to create your problem statement, it’s essential to recognize that users do not always know what they need and, more often than not, they share their wants. These significantly differ from needs because they’re usually based on personal preferences that may vary from user to user. While they may improve the experience by making it more enjoyable, they’re often non-essential in solving the actual root problem. This creates an opportunity to challenge your user insights, asking whether or not they’re grounded in observed user needs or just items that users or stakeholders asked for.
