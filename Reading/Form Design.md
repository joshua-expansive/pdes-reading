# Form Design
Filling out web forms has become an almost integral part of the fabric of our lives. Nearly every online interaction that takes a user from A to B is an online web form: getting in touch with a company, booking a ticket, buying a product, etc. Most users don’t mind filling out a form as long as it’s clear, concise and well-designed.
## Text field anatomy
Text fields allow users to enter text into a UI. They typically appear in forms and dialogs. The design of the text fields should make them discoverable, efficient, and accessible.

Here are key elements of the basic text field: 
1. **Container** — interactable input area 
2. **Input text** — entered into the text field 
3. **Label Text** — tell users what information belongs in a given form field 
4. **Placeholder text** — is a description or example of the information required that is replaced with input text after users provide it 
5. **Helper or Validation text** (optional) — provides additional context or validation message 
6. **Leading icon** (optional) — describe the type of input a text field requires 
7. **Trailing icon** (optional) — additional control for entered text, like clear, hide/show, etc
## Best Practices
#### Design a header with title and introduction
The title should be the shortest and most accurate description of the form. Users tend to skim a form’s content and bypass details or lengthy passages. They should be able to glance at a header and immediately know what’s expected of them without having to read the rest of the text. 
#### Add dividers between content
Using dividers by visually breaking questions up and separating sections and content allows users not to get overwhelmed.
#### Select multi-page or single page form intentionally
If a form has multiple sections, multiple pages are better suited to break up the conversation. Think about first impressions: a user is likely to feel intimidated if faced with a one-page form containing (what looks like) hundreds of fields and a lot of work. Similarly, clicking “Next” for each field over multiple pages is cumbersome and adds to the user’s steps.
#### Personalize Call-to-Actions (CTA)
Use action-driven, personalized language in call-to-actions yields a higher success rate when compared to generic labels like_ “send,”_ _ “submit”_ or _ “process”_—the more descriptive, the better. 

Answer the question _ “I want to…”_ from the user’s perspective to come up with the right messaging. For example, if it’s an inquiry form for a service, it could be ‘Request My Free Consultation.’ 
  
In this [study](http://unbounce.com/conversion-rate-optimization/design-call-to-action-buttons/), Unbounce found that even just changing ‘start your free trial’ to ‘start my free trial’ increased clicks of the call to action by 90%.
#### Label your form fields and use standard formatting
Radio fields, picker fields, and checkboxes work because they are familiar and simple. Using these correctly ensures equals better usability. Use **radio buttons** when there are several options, and you can choose only one. **Checkboxes** work best when users can select more than one option. Use checkboxes and radio buttons rather than **dropdowns**, as they require less [cognitive load](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/minimize-cognitive-load/) to process. As Luke Wroblewski once remarked: “dropdowns should be the UI of last resort.”
#### Always add a confirmation page that thanks the user for their time
There is nothing worse than a user not knowing if they submitted their form successfully. Acknowledge the receipt of their information, and provide the next steps or a thank you to complete the task positively.
## Common patterns
In his article [Text fields & Forms design](https://uxdesign.cc/text-fields-forms-design-ui-components-series-2b32b2beebd0), Taras Bakusevych shares a few input types and best practices that are used for their familiarity and function.
