# Project 1 – Research Guide

## Background
Today, youth spend more time on media than they do in school[^1]. The deluge of news, notifications, and noteworthy entertainment is now experienced instantaneously in all contexts. Older media patterns have been repurposed to fit this new information space. Advertisers must implement more covert forms of marketing as the rise of data-driven optimization and recommendation continues unabated.
There are countless studies about the effects of media use on cognitive and social-emotional development. This research, in contrast, falls under cultural studies; we are interested in the daily lived experience of youth.
## Goal of the study
This research study aims to find insights into how much control youth exert over their social media experience and how their felt sense of control differs from their observed practices and behaviors. The insights gained from this study should help us better define a designer's responsibility to ensure the _sense_ of control youth feel arises from their _actual_ control over social media.
## Research questions
- How in control do youth feel over what they see?
- What are situations that are positive on social media? What are negative situations?
- How would youth re-imagine social media? What would they change? What would they keep?
- What are the health risks associated with social media use and youth?
- What strategies do youth use to find supportive, healthy, and safe spaces on social media? When and how do they take breaks from social media?
## Methodology
1. Desktop domain research
2. Semi-structured interviews
3. User survey
## Participants
- Tweens (8-12 years)
- Early Adolescents (12-15 years)
- Late Adolescents (15-19 years)
