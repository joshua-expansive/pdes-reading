## Background
When it comes to easily booking travel arrangements both affordably and reliably, Kayak.com is a household name. Their primary purpose is to enable their users to find and reserve flights, hotels, and rental vehicles in addition to much more when it comes to booking a trip. However, the market they operate in is saturated with competition. In order for Kayak.com to stay in front of the curve and prevent becoming obsolete they are constantly seeking out additional features or services that will bring value to both their users and their business.

Your role in this project is to inherit and evaluate user interviews conducted by their user research team to identify and implement a feature to their existing product. After analyzing and synthesizing user data, it will be your responsibility to identify, prioritize, ideate, test, and design a feature that will provide value to Kayak.com users. 
## Stakeholder goals
Stakeholders have given you their goals for the new feature. Keep these goals in mind during the project.  
- The product should be more accommodating for groups traveling together.
- The product should help users make more informed choices of what to do at their destination.
- The product experience should feel more personalized to each individual user.
- The product should have an emphasis on safety for inexperienced travelers.
### Tasks
- Conduct exploratory competitive research
- Analyze and code user interview transcripts for insights
- Affinity map insights from initial research
- Create a product roadmap using the 'Jobs to be Done' framework
- Rapidly ideate and iterate on low-fidelity solutions
- Evaluate low-fidelity prototypes to iterate, refine, and create a mid-fidelity prototype
- Create a formative test plan and script
- Conduct mock formative user tests
- Iterate mid-fidelity prototype based on insights
- Annotate wireframes for hand-off
### Audience Discovery
