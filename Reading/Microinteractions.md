# Microinteractions

Micro-interactions are everywhere. When users tweak the settings on a device, create new account passwords, and share on social media, they will encounter tons of small and nearly invisible interactions. These micro-interactions help users be more productive in accomplishing tasks and create unique, engaging, and fun moments as they use the product. These small moments are essential, though, and sometimes are the difference between users liking a product and loving a product. 

At their most basic level, micro-interactions are trigger-feedback pairs. In defining each, triggers typically fall into two categories, manual and automatic.

-   **Manual** - A trigger that is initiated by the user’s action. 
    
-   **Automatic** - A trigger that is initiated by the system’s state.
    

The feedback is the response to the trigger and is communicated through small, highly contextual (usually visual) changes on the product or the user interface.

Because of the trigger-feedback relationship, rules must be established to define precisely how the interaction should work. All micro-interactions should have clear and definite criteria for what qualifies as a trigger and its subsequent feedback—the action and reaction. Loops, or modes, must also be considered to determine what happens to a micro-interaction when conditions change. If a user navigates away from the page or returns to a previous state, what happens with the micro-interaction that just occurred?

### Approaching Microinteraction Designs

Although micro-interactions are usually designed later in the design process, there is a strong temptation to begin high-fidelity. But like most other parts of the design process, starting in high fidelity can be incredibly time-consuming when exploring concepts. So how do designers rapidly ideate around creating these digital experiences? One of the most popular methods is sketching low-fidelity screens, like the 6-8-5 activity, or using storyboards, as shown in the example below.

When sketching storyboards, it should be clear who the end-user is and the context around the micro-interaction. What is the scenario in which that micro-interaction will occur? It is not enough to show the interaction itself and have some context around the initial trigger before it happens. Also, because triggers do not always occur on an interface, sketching can be a better way to represent the concept visually.

Once micro-interactions have been conceptualized, the strongest of the bunch should be implemented in higher fidelity prototypes for testing. 

With some definitions of micro-interactions, why they are used, and how they are created, let’s examine some real-life examples of micro-interactions.
### Physical Device Manual Trigger
In both of these examples, a manual trigger is applied to the device. The user toggles the switch or turns the knob. The feedback is the exposure or alignment of the orange indicator on each device. This orange indicator lets the user know if the setting is toggled on or off and where the volume is set.

### Digital Interface Manual Trigger
In the following example, the user performs an action on a digital interface. By tapping an element on the screen, the user triggers feedback from the product, revealing more information or tools the user may need. They aren’t overly complex but are a good representation of what it means to be unique, engaging, and fun. It is also clear the designer had definite rules for the trigger, feedback, rules, and loop, which make these successful micro-interactions.

### System/Automatic Trigger
Notifications can be used as feedback for automatic triggers. When a change occurs in the systems status, say a failure to load, feedback is given to the user that the task failed.
