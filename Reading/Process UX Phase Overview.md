**Welcome to Process UX**
This is the first of five phases dedicated to the craft of Product Design. During this phase, you will complete two projects that teach you about product strategy, UX research, and product design. With each project, you will become familiar with the methods best suited to accomplish the project outcomes.  

**Project 1** is about understanding **who** you are designing for, and **what** their needs are. First, you'll learn how to quickly orient yourself within an unfamiliar domain. Then you'll refine the market segments for the research, and decide the most appropriate research questions for exploratory research. You'll finish Project 1 by writing a survey and an interview guide and script for semi-structured user interviews. 

**Project 2** will teach you to make sense out of unstructured research. You'll identify possible opportunities to help people and carefully frame and communicate those opportunities as problem statements. Then you will put your brain to work generating ideas and testing solutions to those problem statements. Then you'll improve the information architecture of a set of wireframes and create a prototype suitable for usability testing. 

You'll be using [Figma](http://figma.com) as your primary design tool. We'll teach you everything you need to know to create modern, accessible design work. You'll see why the design community is so excited about Figma's capabilities. Now onward! üëè
