# Facilitating Group Synthesis 
For the best chance for success, you will need to create the right conditions. As much as you have probably tried to remove yourself (and bias) from the research process, you will intentionally bring it into the synthesis process. So consider who should take part in a session. Involving stakeholders, users, or subject matter experts can extend the team’s interpretation of the data. If you are working on a marketing website, asking someone from sales or marketing to participate could help. They will also be bringing new data to combine with yours, which can be a challenge. 

Synthesis involves taking creative leaps, and you might feel self-conscious during a synthesis exercise. Establishing psychological safety during a synthesis session is critical to making more significant creative leaps that might result in a new insight. Some of your participants may not have participated in a session like this before. Or they may have had a negative experience with a session that was not productive. 

All of your research skills will be valuable during facilitation. Like doing user interviews, you want to keep asking questions, building rapport, and integrating everyone’s perspective. 

During synthesis, interpretations might clash. Do not immediately dismiss these ideas. Instead, dig deeper into what lies behind the contrasting meanings. In doing so, you are exploring unknown spaces. Creative tension is a valuable tool for investigating different directions. It’s not about right or wrong, but about finding something novel, helpful, and interesting in the data.

## Externalize the data
During a synthesis session, one of the goals is to see all the information at once. The content will need to be manipulated, rearranged, torn apart, and rebuilt. Whether you are using sticky notes or software, the output quality is only as good as the information input quality. It might require a hefty amount of preparation to transform the raw data into the building blocks you need.
