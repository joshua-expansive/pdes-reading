# Research Synthesis: Credible Insights
More than 2,000 years ago Aristotle had kicked around the concept of ‘credibility’. He expressed it as the key ingredient in convincing people to trust you. Following this logic, credibility is the thing that precedes trust. You must have one before the other. As UX and product designers, we strive to gain the trust of our users to keep them engaged with our products and to gain their loyalty to our business. In order to gain that trust, you need to be credible in the decisions you make with your product. The big question is, how do designers establish credibility?

Picture this scenario: You go to the mechanic because your car is acting up. It’s making a lot of noises and even some smells you don’t recognize. You explain what you’ve been experiencing to the mechanic. They run some tests and take a look under the hood of your car. When the mechanic comes back to you, they say they have some bad news. You’re going to need some major repairs that are going to be expensive to make. But the mechanic doesn’t explain the cause of the noises and smells your car has been making or how that translates into an expensive repair. Only that an expensive repair is needed. Without having more information about the root cause of the noises/smells and why the repairs are necessary, you may begin to question the mechanic’s credibility.

In the world of design, credibility is built through insights gained in research informing ideas, concepts, and features added to your product. This is ultimately the central concept behind ‘human-centered design’. The insights you gain are like the mechanic telling you why the repairs are needed and what it will do to address the problems with noises and smells. We know the end result was a new feature, or a major car repair, but we now understand why that need existed so we would be much more likely to have the repairs done. When that link is made for the user, credibility has been established and we have our foot in the door to gain their trust. 

In the process of synthesizing research and insights, it will feel tempting to solve for each problem you encounter. It’s difficult not to ideate and think of creative solutions to problems when you encounter them. However, this practice can be dangerous as you may be jumping to conclusions which run the risk of ruining credibility, and trust, with your users if insights are not vetted carefully. When synthesizing your first rounds of insights, take time to frame them appropriately. Dig beneath the surface to analyze the insight from all angles to ensure it reflects reality for the product and your users. Your ideas and proposed concepts should be firmly rooted in research and can be traced back to it. 

Below is a simple framework to help frame your research observations into concepts and ideas for your product. By following these steps, you are less likely to be jumping to conclusions from your research and presenting ideas that have strong credibility.

1.  Observations - What are the patterns or key themes from the research?
2.  Insights - Why are they important? Why are patterns happening? What is the impact these insights have?
3.  Guiding Principles - What should be done in support of those insights?
4.  Concept - How might we..?

Using this framework can help translate your observations from research into concepts and ideas that have strong credibility. It also works in reverse when explaining to key stakeholders how you arrived at the concept you did to gain their trust and buy-in.
