# Persuasive Design
## What is Persuasive Design?
Persuasive design focuses on influencing human behavior and encouraging continued engagement or action. As technology became interactive, its potential to influence behavior has increased immensely. 

Persuasive design is often used in e-commerce, organizational management, and public health. Poster campaigns and television advertisements have always played a significant role in influencing human intentions and behaviors. Technology today allows designers to adapt to the user’s input, needs, and in return, praise or reciprocate them in the most appropriate moment or situation.

People want to spend the least amount of time and effort to complete a task. They have grown to expect instant gratification. Designers should set expectations early and incorporate immediate feedback and results. There are primarily three user considerations before they make decisions, and designers need to solve for these to persuade users to act:
-   the time and effort it takes
-   how much it costs
-   the benefit or value
## Common Persuasive Design Principles
### Framing
Framing presents a comparison for the end-user in an appealing way before they decide to purchase or sign up. It’s natural for users to see what brings them the most value, and this helps them choose the option that’s just right.

In this example, the “most popular” flag is a subtle nudge to persuade the user to see how that pricing plan could be just right for them.

In this example, Amazon helps compare all the features at the different price points for the user to decide on their Ring doorbell purchase.

### Reciprocity
Reciprocity is the principle of “returning the favor.” People don’t want to feel like they’ve taken advantage of someone’s generosity (including that of a business) so they feel obligated to repay favors.

In this example, Duolingo offers to teach a language for free before signing up for an account.

### Scarcity
Users place more value on something “almost sold out” or available for a “limited time.” This encourages them to be more decisive and quick to take action.

###### By calling out “small batch” and “limited edition print,” the business is leveraging the principle of scarcity to entice users to decide to purchase quickly.

### Social Proof
People usually do what they see others do, or they’ll wait to see what others have done before them before doing it themselves. This is the principle of social proof. It reassures users that they aren’t the only ones taking action.

### Authority
People often look to experts and trusted sources for the information they can use when making a decision. Just using the term “expert” positively impacts someone’s likelihood of making a purchase. When people see a recommendation from an expert, they are more likely to take action.

Presenting a smaller, “expert-selected” selection of gray paint colors in a sea of options brings users closer to selecting the gray that’s right for them.

### Salience
What users pay attention to drives their decisions, and their choices drive their actions. The persuasive design principle of salience is that people pay attention to what is most important to them first. When considering the effectiveness of a web page, it’s helpful to ask “what is most salient or commands attention?” vs. “what should be salient on the page.”
