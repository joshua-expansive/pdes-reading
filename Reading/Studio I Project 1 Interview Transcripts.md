## Interview Transcripts

### Interview 1

Moderator: Hey Christina, thanks for meeting with me today. Before we start, would you like a glass of water or anything? 

Christina: Actually, that would be great. (gets water) 

Moderator: To get started, could you go ahead and tell me a little bit about yourself and your background? 

Christina: Sure. My name is Christina Wang, I'm 32 and live in Chicago, Illinois with my partner, Adam and our cat, Moochi. I work as a copywriter for an ad agency downtown and live in the Logan Square neighborhood right off the Blue Line. 

Moderator: Great. Now can you walk me through what a typical day for you looks like? 

Christina: Sure, I would say on a typical day I wake up and go to the gym. Come home and grab a meal that I prepped the day before and then head to work around 9:15. I usually work until about 6 p.m. and then catch the blue line back to my neighborhood. When I get home, I finalize and send off some last minute emails, cook dinner, and prep for the next day. 

Moderator: Awesome. Now, how does technology factor into your day? 

Christina: Well, my alarm is my phone, so I would have to say that I get up and immediately check my phone. After that, I brush my teeth, fix my hair and usually scroll through Instagram, catch up with my sister, and check the news. 

Moderator: Nice what other apps do you use? 

Christina: I’m a huge fan of Instagram, Facebook, The New York Times, and Foursquare. I can’t really tell you why I love Foursquare; I think I’m the only person that still uses that app. I guess I just want to be the mayor at my favorite coffee house. I even have the owners beat. Apart from those, I use Venmo, SpotHero, and my Soulcycle app so I know what classes are happening for the week. 

Moderator: That’s great, I use Venmo and SpotHero all the time. Now, do you use any of these apps while you travel? 

Christina: Where I go will kind of dictate what apps I'm using. If I go to New York City, I'll likely use Uber or Lyft once or twice, but I'll mainly use the MTA. If I'm in Austin, Texas, I'll probably use Venmo to pay for drinks or gas money instead of Uber or Lyft because all my friends there have cars. I wouldn’t say I have a go to app so much as my environment changes what I’ll use. 

Moderator: How often do you go on trips? 

Christina: I try to leave Chicago once a month but every once in a while that gets pushed back, so I would say I typically go on a trip every four to six weeks, whether that's taking a road trip over a long weekend, or catching a flight somewhere fun. 

Moderator: Oh that's great. How do you usually pick your destinations? 

Christina: If I'm going to visit family, I usually take the car because they're just in Indiana. If I'm going to visit my friends who are out of state and more than 2 hours away, I'll likely fly just because I don't want to be in a car for that long. For fun trips, I plan around two to four months ahead of time and set up accounts with TripAdvisor and other companies to find cheap airfare. I love booking trips in advance because that gives me something to look forward to. 

Moderator: Can you walk me through the last time you went on one of these vacations? 

Christina: Totally. So about two months ago I went on a family vacation to Venice. I've been to Europe a few times, but this was the first time that I've gone with my family and not with friends or through a study abroad program. While I'm not the biggest fan of family vacations as I often feel like I need to take a vacation after a family vacation, this specific trip was especially terrible. 

Moderator: Yikes. What made it so bad? 

Christina: My dad was working the entire time and couldn't plan ahead, so my mom was stuck doing all the planning, and she's not very tech savvy. The place where we were staying wasn't in the best neighborhood, so we often didn't feel comfortable walking around at night. The places we went for food were all tourist traps and right off of the main areas. I don't know if you've ever been to Italy, but everything was just one long line after another, so I felt like half of the trip was spent waiting for something that wasn't worth it or was overpriced for what it was. 

Moderator: Yikes. What about the neighborhood didn’t make you feel comfortable? 

Christina: Italian men can be pretty aggressive and drinking out in the street was allowed, so I would often get cat-called and harassed by men half-falling over. From my experience, most italian men watch American media and think that all American women are promiscuous and attainable. Thankfully, some friends who visited previously warned me about that particular issue before I went, so I was pretty cognizant to keep an eye out for that type of behavior. 

Moderator: Wow I’m sorry to hear that. Did you take any preventative measures? 

Christina: I would usually just act like I was on the phone with someone, or if I had reception, I actually would be on the phone with someone. I’ve had friends that have used the Watch Over Me App, but that’s only if they live in a specific neighborhood or have been victims of assault before. 

Moderator: You mentioned previously that you mom had planned this trip and that’s how you ended up in this neighborhood in the first place, now how does this differ from how you plan trips? 

Christina: When I plan for trips, I usually have a destination in mind. Whether I'm visiting a friend or going based on someone I follow on Instagram who visited a place and shared incredible photos. I’ll often save their photos on my personal Instagram account as a reference point so I when I’m thinking of places to go I have a few to choose from. As soon as I pick the location, I immediately start researching blogs, hashtags and articles from Eater because I’m kind of a foodie. My idea of a perfect trip is having spent every minute enriched in the culture of a place, and getting to live in their shoes. I like to meet locals and get a better understanding of what their day-to-day lives are like. I once went to China and visited a tea shop only to be invited back to the owner's house for a traditional Cantonese meal with her family. It was by far the best meal I had that entire trip, and it would have only happened by talking to people and killing them with kindness. 

Moderator: That sounds amazing. What took you to the tea shop in the first place? 

Christina: My friend Lisa has a tea company called Big Heart Tea Co., and I was trying to find her some obscure stuff she doesn't have on her shelves. 

Moderator: So how else would you have made that Venice trip different? 

Christina: You mean beyond the United flight, the long wait times, and our stay in a haunted hostel? 

Moderator: haha, sure. 

Christina: I would say that my biggest issue was that we had a plan, but the execution was so poor. Our phones were also not getting service in that area, so for the first three days it was almost impossible to get in touch with each other. I don't know what your relationship is with your parents, but after 72 hours attached to each other's hips, I needed a break, but even that was difficult because I couldn't leave and then meet up with them later. I think if I were to plan the trip, beyond giving everyone a physical copy of their day broken down as an itinerary, I would also put in little breaks here and there for exploration so people could do their own thing. Like, there's only so many Renaissance paintings you can look at before you're just like, “Great, another Lady Madonna and child painting.” I also wish that there had been more collaboration with what we actually wanted to see. I love my parents, but they’re the type of people that wear their passports under three layers of clothes and only go to restaurants that have photos of the food on the menu. I would have found us a nice Airbnb with a jacuzzi for my mom and separate bedrooms, so I wouldn’t have to hear my dad's snoring. 

Moderator: What other issues did you run into? 

Christina: We had a really hard time getting tickets. You would think that you could just get tickets at a ticket counter, but that’s not always the case in Europe. A lot of these places still use paper tickets instead of buying online and using an app like Eventbrite. Besides that, we didn’t have things outlined so if something fell through, we were just out that two hours. 

Moderator: When you mentioned that you needed to break away from the parents, what does that entail? 

Christina: If there was something that I wanted or needed to do that involved a solo trip somewhere, it was really hard to get everyone on the same page. We’d end up using some restaurant as a meeting point to get back together, and undoubtedly someone would run late and the other person would have to sit there for however long waiting. 

Moderator: Interesting. Now earlier when you were talking about how you would plan the trip, You mentioned being a big fan of Airbnb? What other services, if any, do you use? 

Christina: I like Airbnb for booking accommodations, but I'm not a big fan of their experiences. My boyfriend, Adam, planned a trip for our 3-year anniversary to Mexico City and ended up buying a lot of their experiences. I’m not sure if it was his poor judgment or if it was the options they had available, but all the things we did felt like Groupons, which no person really elects to choose. I don't know if you've worked in the restaurant industry, but Groupon is mainly trying to help small businesses stay afloat, and the employees absolutely hate to give those discounts because those don't reflect the actual price you need to be tipping for, etcetera. 

Moderator: How would you have liked that experience to work? 

Christina: I would rather Airbnb suggest things based on my interests, my profile or (minimally) my previous experience. Kind of like the way Amazon always bundles packages together or tries to sell you items based on your buying history. If I were to rent a treehouse in Brazil for instance, you could assume that I’m probably pretty fond of the outdoors, so why not extend your offering to take a zip line course and or nature hikes. This is a little different than Airbnb’s model, but it would also be nice to have famous restaurants in the area or a top 10 list similar to what Thrillist or Eatery offers. I don't want to miss anything when I’m in unfamiliar territory, and that includes off-the-beaten path places and that famous speakeasy behind a laundromat that only serves gin prohibition-era cocktails. 

Moderator: What do you like about those top 10 lists? 

Christina: I like that those companies understand their consumer and they seem to have a good pulse on the city. It’s not some small local magazine where you can buy an ad and be featured. These are what other travelers see when they’re in your shoes. If I were to go to Egypt, I would, of course, want to look at the pyramids, but if there is also a rooftop bar close by where I could go after I visit the pyramids and still see them from a distance while sipping on a sweet Aviation cocktail, I’m all about that life. 

Moderator: Yeah -- that sounds amazing. When reflecting on some of your answers, you had mentioned that poor planning and communication was a huge factor in why your Venice trip didn't work out. Were you able to find any workarounds or ways to make that trip better? 

Christina: When we had reliable internet service I would post up at a cafe and try to source as many Yelp reviews or Thrillist articles I could find. While my parents never took advantage of my research, my sister and I went clubbing for one night when we were there but let's say the reviews were generous. 

Moderator: The club didn’t match the expectation? 

Christina: The place we went had the most reviews and drinks were good, but there was hardly anyone there. I’m not sure if that’s just the nightlife in Venice, but the only thing scurrying around at four in the morning were my sister and I and some gargantuan rats. 

Moderator: Are you the type of person that leaves reviews? 

Christina: Not usually, having worked in the service industry I know how hard a lot of those jobs can be and how little respect you get from the public. Reviews hurt a lot of small mom and pop shops, so if I leave a review, it’s only for a larger company like United Airlines. 

Moderator: How often do you read reviews? 

Christina: I actually read a lot of reviews before I make a purchase or decide to go anywhere. If it’s a restaurant or a product, I’ll read the reviews and look at the pictures, but honestly nothing beats a local’s perspective. I love to meet people and have those special connections that really make a trip memorable. 

Moderator: Is that something you do? 

Christina: Absolutely. Once I find one great place, I’ll often ask the store clerk what else is in the area. I like to use those suggestions more than reviews. With reviews you run into the risk of one disgruntled customer who speaks for everyone. 

Moderator: Did you run across any other issues on your travels? 

Christina: Not being able to connect via phone was really challenging, I told my parents that I'm going to get us walkie-talkies for the next time they try to drag us along on one of these family trips. Honestly next time I'm just going to plan everything and download it to my phone, so even if I have no service or I’m out of cell range, I can still see a map and the itinerary for the day. Sending stuff to your email is also a clever workaround but only as a last resort. I don’t want to have to dig around my inbox to find the one note that I sent myself. 

Moderator: That’s understandable. Well, I want to be respectful of your time, and I know you have to get back to work. Before I go ahead and stop this recording, are there any last things you want to discuss? 

Christina: No. I think we covered most of it. Hopefully you can make something that makes family trips tolerable and can also help my partner Adam make decisions better. 

Moderator: Only time will tell. Thanks again for meeting with me.


### Interview 2

Moderator: Hey Oliver, I’m working with the company, Kayak.com and they’re interested in people’s travel habits to develop something to assist in that space. Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? Name, Age, where you live, things like that?

Oliver: Sure, my name is Oliver Hammond, I'm 31, and I work as a motion graphic designer. I live in the East Village (New York) with my partner, Ezra and our rescue pup, Delores. I'm originally from Massachusetts, but moved to New York for school and never left. 

Moderator: Ah, why didn’t you leave?

Oliver: I fell in love with the city. I love how polarizing New York is. You either love it, or you hate it. There’s just an energy to this city that can’t be replicated anywhere else. I also love my neighborhood. It still has a bunch of weirdos running around from the 70’s so the people watching is spectacular, but the rent keeps going up so we’ll likely have to move to the upper east side or rent a studio in Chelsea in a year or two. I’ve come to justify the cost of our apartment as a convenience tax. Our rent is subsidized by cheap food options, great art, culture, and 24-hr access to anything we could need. It took me a while to figure it out, but it’s all about budgeting, cooking meals at home, becoming a connoisseur of the NYC dollar slice, riding your bike everywhere, and eating bodega sandwiches at 3 am. 

Moderator: It sounds like you’ve got a handle on the big apple. What do you typically budget for in a given year? 

Oliver: We typically set up our budget four months in advance so we can prepare for major holidays, and cover any of life’s happy or unhappy accidents. It’s also nice just to be able to track and project out for anything. Perhaps put more money into our savings account for fun stuff. 

Moderator: What’s fun stuff? 

Oliver: Oh, you know. Nights out, shows, furniture, trips, gifts for family and friends. 

Moderator: How often do you purchase these things? 

Oliver: The last appliance I got was a countertop dishwasher. It’s completely amazing and highly suggest you Google it after this interview. 

Moderator: Sounds like a kitchen game-changer 

Oliver: T ruly. Anyways, I haven’t bought any furniture this year, and we have been really good about eating at home, but we did take a few trips. Every year, Ezra and I drive to Boston to see my parents for Thanksgiving, and then Fly to L.A. to visit his parents for Christmas. Which is always preferred, because then you can get away from the snow for a few days. Besides that, we usually plan two week-long vacations each year, and go camping upstate or take road trips to Cape Cod on holiday weekends. Although this year Ezra surprised me for my birthday and we went to Montreal. 

Moderator: Oh nice, what did you do in Montreal? 

Oliver: That trip was a total nightmare. Ezra, God bless his soul, tried to do something nice and spontaneous, but it did not pan out. He's notoriously bad at coming up with gifts so he used this service called Pack Up + Go to plan the whole trip for him. He set a budget, and they picked out the city, the tickets, and prepared all of these activities that we could choose from, but their system is messed up or someone has a really sick sense of humor because we ended up going to Montreal in the middle of February. Have you been to Montreal in February? It's absolutely freezing. There is an entire tunnel system underground so that people don't need to be outside it's that cold. I think they were supposed to send us an email a week before we were set to go, but it was forwarded to his spam folder, so we didn’t really know what to pack. 

Moderator: W as this the first time Ezra had used this service? 

Oliver: Y eah and we vowed never to use it again. The activities they had planned for us just weren't appealing, it's hard to say without knowing what all of our options were, and if we could spend the extra $20 to get better tickets or swap for something that was maybe a little more our style. We ended up trying to walk around some of these cute neighborhoods and find coffee shops and small galleries to duck into, but it was so cold that we sadly spent a lot of time in the mall because it was underground. 

Moderator: That ’s unfortunate. You mentioned that your partner couldn’t do this on his own. Do you usually plan the trips? If so, how do you typically prepare for these trips?

Oliver: W ell, for one, I take seasons into consideration. I’m not going to visit Norway when they don’t have the sun or go to Australia in the winter because that’s their summer. Typically, when I travel, I go with something specific in mind. Like going to Peru to see Machu Picchu and hike the Inca trail, talk to the locals experience their cuisine, and tour a coffee farm. I worked as a barista at a Birch coffee while I was in undergrad and I’ve grown to have an appreciation for that trade. That’s why I was so bummed that we went to Montreal. I imagine Montreal in the summer, or early fall is breathtaking, but we didn’t see any of that. We stayed shacked up in our hotel room, getting poutine delivered and trying to hit the major attractions. 

Moderator: So if you didn't like all of the suggestions that this company used, how did you find out about all of these attractions and get poutine delivered? 

Oliver: I got on Instagram and searched their hashtags, I'm also a big fan of blogs and Reddit. Blogs like To Europe and Beyond were pretty influential to our decision-making process. We found an outstanding amount of coffee shops through that blog. It was pretty much our saving grace every morning. We would find a coffee shop and then work our way around that neighborhood. 

Moderator: How did you find those resources? 

Oliver: Typically Google or friends or people I follow on Instagram who have their own blogs. Once you find one good blog they usually hype up the other blogs. 

Moderator: So when it comes to public transportation, do you commute to one specific spot and then explore the neighborhood? 

Oliver: If I'm not familiar with the city that's definitely an option. I'm typically the one who plans all of our trips, so I have everything planned down to the breaks in between each activity. But when I find myself in a foreign city with limited resources and time, I'll often Google things near me and visit places based on reviews and general interest. I've been burned a few times by doing that, but that's not to say that it doesn't sometimes work out. I just wish there was like a top 10 list with things I can save and upvote. 

Moderator: What about those top 10 lists do you enjoy? 

Oliver: They’re excellently curated. They have what it is, why its on the list, what they’re known for and directions to get there. You already feel like an expert before you walk in the door. 

Moderator: So when you typically plan for trips, do you usually factor those lists into your planning? 

Oliver: When I plan for trips, I usually plan 3 to 4 months out. Ezra and I have a running list of all of these places that we want to visit in South America and Eastern Asia, so we typically choose which location we want to go to, I book the tickets through my Capital One card to get more points for more trips later. For lodging, we usually stay with friends if we know someone there or we’ll stay at an Airbnb. I've been using Airbnb since they first started and Ezra was a big fan of the Couchsurfing app. I don't even know if that's still a thing anymore, but we're all about the sharing economy. It's a great way to save money, and get closer to the neighborhoods you want to visit. If you have a good host you can usually change your check in and check out times, or they'll minimally the hold your bag for you when you book your flights later in the afternoon. The three to four month lead-up time gives us the option to prioritize what we want to see and also make sure that those attractions are open. We went to Paris once and some of the things we wanted to see were under construction, so we ended up missing a lot of what we wanted to see. It was still a good trip but that's definitely something that's been put on our radar now to look out for. Obviously, if a water main breaks or a fire happens or a natural disaster occurs, you're kind of out of luck but fortunately we haven't run across those problems. 

Moderator: Having gone through that experience, how do you check to make sure that the places you’re wanting to visit are open for business?

Oliver: We’ll use Google and call ahead if it’s something we really want to see. Occasionally, Yelp, but it’s rare that they are updated. 

Moderator: What is the process of finding those places and building out your days? 

Oliver: I’d say we're pretty Democratic, we usually take things to a vote. We're both lovers of art, so typically our trips include museums, curio shops, local eateries, and independent bookstores. We don't argue that much when it comes to the core of what we're going to see. If anything the bigger problem is whittling it down to what we can see in such a short amount of time. The name of the game is maximizing our time in a different city and just being with each other. 

Moderator: What is your process for whittling away to what you genuinely want to do? 

Oliver: A lot of that is dependent on the distance from where we find an Airbnb, the price, the ratings, and general interest. We went to visit friends in Seattle a few years ago, and I've always wanted to see Mount Rainier, but that's a two-hour trip in traffic. For an extra 30 minutes you could take the ferry to Victoria and be in Canada, and you won't even have to drive. As someone who's lived without a car for years now, if I can avoid getting behind the wheel, I will definitely do that. 

Moderator: So what do you do when you're traveling in a foreign country? 

Oliver: We’ll mainly use their public transit, taxis or bikes if there's a Citi, Lime or Ofo bike sharing program. It depends on the weather, our budget, and the distance. If I've been walking all day and the next place is 20 miles away, I'll just take a taxi instead of burning my legs out biking there. 

Moderator: Wow, you’re really non stop when you travel. 

Oliver: Oh absolutely. Whether we're going someplace to get away from the city or if we're visiting my cousin in Japan, we really try to get the most out of our trips. 

Moderator: Visiting Japan has always been a dream of mine. 

Oliver: You have to go. It's the most organized city in the world. Imagine a clean New York where chaos doesn’t reign supreme. When I went to visit my cousin, she ended up taking me to a lot of really great restaurants, a dicey bar named Gold Finger, and all these really great vintage shops. I ended up buying a whole bunch of kimonos and mailing them to my friend in L.A. who owns the shop, Scout. It was hilarious because three months later he sent me a magazine with one of the Olsen twins wearing a kimono that I picked out. How crazy is that? I'm really fortunate to have such a great friend group; they always seem to know the best spots. 

Moderator: How much would you say your friend group influences your decisions? 

Oliver: Quite a bit. I'm always looking for recommendations on places to go and things to see. I'll follow them on Instagram and take note of exciting places that Ezra and I could go and see. I also really trust their judgment. They're the first ones to say when things didn't work out, so I can learn from their mistakes and make all new ones. But seriously, half of our travel is following in other people's footsteps and then making some new ones for our friends to discover things. 

Moderator: So it's like a marathon race, you're like passing the Baton of knowledge. 

Oliver: Totally. If I can spare you any discomfort and share my insights, I'm going to do it. If you want to see the Mona Lisa, crack open an art history book, you're going to get way closer to understanding that piece then you would if you were to go to the Louvre. If anything, you go to the Louvre to admire the architecture of that building, the art is just a nice gift with purchase in my opinion, and there are loads of small independent art galleries with cute bakeries that aren't swamped with tourists. 

Moderator: Do you and your friend group have a directory of all of these places you've been with the sites that you've seen? 

Oliver: I keep notes of everything that we've done and keep them in a folder on my computer. If I know someone is looking for recommendations or has a trip planned to a place I've been before, I'll ask first and upon approval, send them a long email of all of the stuff that's worth visiting. I love being able to impact somebody else's experience because then that becomes a shared experience. They'll often send me pictures or make a post on Instagram and tag me in their photo as if I was there. It's actually a really sweet gesture, and I feel closer to my friends by doing that, even though we all live in entirely different parts of the world. 

Moderator: Awesome, well thank you for sharing your wealth of knowledge, I didn't know that you traveled to all of those places, that's incredible. I'll be sure to capture all of these notes and send them off to this company. 

Oliver: That would be great I’d love to have an impact on other people's travel beyond my friend group.

### Interview 3

Moderator: Hey Michael, thanks for meeting with me today. I'm currently working with the company Kayak.com, and they're interested in your travel experience so that we can create a tool to help assist in that space. Now I understand that you travel a lot for work as well as a few times of year with your partner is that correct? 

Michael: Yeah, my full-time job in advertising has me traveling a lot to different areas of the Midwest. I also work as a contractor for companies to hire out and film conferences and do photo shoots. I initially was doing that for my old company and then that splintered into working with all of the companies they partnered with. I would say I typically travel six to eight times a year filming conferences on contract, and once every quarter for my full-time job. My wife and I usually try to get out of town twice a year whenever we have vacation time. But that will likely change as we just bought a house and are trying to start our family. We actually just found out that we were pregnant two months ago, so now we need to start saving and planning for that. 

Moderator: Oh wow, congratulations. How long have you and your partner been married? 

Michael: We've been married for four years now, but together for eight. We got together when I was 26, and Kate was 29. We've only seriously been trying to have kids for the last year, but are somewhat pressed for time because there’s a solid timeframe to have kids before that starts to become difficult. 

Moderator: That’s great. What does your wife do? Michael: My wife works as a biologist for a research plant in the greater St. Louis area. She's originally from Ohio but moved to St. Louis for school, and in her field there are only a few cities that you can find jobs, so we could stay in St. Louis or move to Seattle, and while we love Seattle it's too expensive. I'm fortunate that I can work from home most days and also work from the office downtown. 

Moderator: Nice. You had mentioned that you and your wife travel two times a year, can you walk me through that? 

Michael: Sure. First off, that's not a hundred percent accurate. I would say that we take two vacations a year where we will go and take time off work and actually spend a week or so traveling, but if I get put on a work trip and I can extend an extra 3 days, I'll usually try to fly Kate out so that we can make a little vacation out of it. A good example would be when I had to fly to Brussels for a conference that I was filming, and once the work was over, I just moved my return flight back a few days and paid for Kate’s roundtrip ticket. Essentially, working that conference, allowed me to get a free trip to Brussels for both myself and my wife, and we had four days to explore the city. 

Moderator: That sound nice. How did you plan for that trip? 

Michael: For the Brussels trip? Typically the company that I work for has 4 to 6 conferences a year, not including other conferences that I do contract for. They usually book those out a full year in advance. This gives my wife and me plenty of time to figure out what we want to do and how best we can use our vacation time. I would say out of all the conferences I go to, Kate, My wife, will go to go to two or three of them. Both of us have the travel bug and love to explore new countries. So far we’ve been to Japan, Ireland, Scotland, Korea, Germany, Brussels, and Sweden. We knew this probably wasn't going to be possible when we decided to settle down and start a family, as one of us would need to stay at home, so we spent the last four years taking advantage of that. If there's a location that doesn’t interest Kate, like Jacksonville, Florida or a conference in Tucson, Arizona I’ll fly out for the meeting and fly home. 

Moderator: That’s great. You’re going to be a globe-trotting family soon. 

Michael: Ideally, the budget i s going to be tight with a child, so we’re trying to account for that and all the housework that needs to get done. We’ll likely not travel for the first three years while we’re acclimating to our new family dynamic. I can't wait to show our child the world, but I’m a little apprehensive about flying when they'll be so young. Kate and I often backpack and spend a lot of time walking around wherever we are, and I have a feeling this is going to slow us down quite a bit. Kate already has a restrictive diet, being gluten-free and vegetarian, which can cause some issues when traveling in a profoundly meat-centric country. We went to Buenos Aires for a conference she didn't have that many options for food, especially when we left the city. 

Moderator: Interesting, so how do you account for that when traveling? 

Michael: We usually build out an itinerary that includes a lot of restaurants and then fall-back restaurants if those restaurants have either shut down or aren't open the days that we are there. It's kind of strange. I've never had to work around that until I met Kate but as I'm getting older, I realize I can't tolerate spicy foods, so we're both getting pretty picky as we age. Usually will use Yelp, The Legal Nomad, which is a food blog, and then another blog called The Nomadic Vegan. While neither of us is vegan, it’s just good to cover all of our bases as most vegan places accommodate Kate’s lifestyle. 

Moderator: Interesting, so when you go to a place like Berlin that has a lot of vegan restaurants, what makes you decide to choose one over another? 

Michael: Typically reviews or things that friends mentioned in passing. Kate looks for specific words like “gluten-free” and “Celiac” in the review descriptions to make sure that there are other people with her condition that didn’t end up getting sick. There are a lot of hidden ingredients in our food, but she’s pretty good at sniffing those out. Kate also used some apps for a while. One was called AllergyEats and I think the other was called DineSafe, but we could only use those apps for when we go on trips domestically because it doesn’t work outside of the states. 

Moderator: So besides restaurants what else do you typically do whenever you're traveling? 

Michael: Whenever we're not looking for restaurants, we often go to historical monuments, museums, conservatories, and a bunch of different gardens. We’re both history buffs, so when we’re in historically rich places, we're looking down the barrel of a tank, jumping in submarines, storming castles, and running through museums. I couldn’t think of a better way to travel. Some of our friends relax on an island or take repeat trips to Disneyland, and while I respect their decision to do so, I just don’t get it. We have a limited amount of time on this earth, and I want to see as much of it as possible. 

Moderator: How do you typically find all of these places of interest? The tanks, the museums, etc? 

Michael: I feel old saying this, but the Lonely Planet. They’re somewhat pricey, so we tend to use some of their ideas, but we never order anything through them. Sometimes inspiration comes from documentaries we’ve watched or just places we know based on their historical significance. We looked for apps that highlight culturally significant landmarks, but all of the ones we downloaded were clearly in Beta. 

Moderator: Was there anything about those apps that you liked? 

Michael: Some of them had really interesting details and fun facts about the places we were visiting, but a lot were uploaded from other tourists, so who knows how accurate they actually were. They also didn’t have any information to help us build our itinerary. 

Moderator: What would you want this app to do? 

Michael: Well, I wish they would have things like hours of operation, tickets and recommendations based on similar interests. Moderator: So then when’s the next trip? Michael: Great question! I’m going solo to Omaha for a conference next month, but the next vacation we’re taking, Kate and I are going to Florence, Cinque Terre, and Capri. This is one of the rare occasions when we’re paying for it, and it’s not a work trip, but it will be our last hurrah before the baby is born. While I know Italy is pretty gluten-heavy, Kate has already found a few restaurants that we can order from, and there are tons of markets where we can find food to bring back to our Airbnb and cook. The plan is to get an Airbnb to save money and then use the kitchen to prepare snacks for our day trips so that we can split larger meals when we’re out. Since she’s pregnant, I’m not going to drink in camaraderie, and that will also save us some money. 

Moderator: Were you always this budget conscious or is this a recent occurrence? 

Michael: To some degree, we've always been conscious of our spending. I’ve broken down our spending to my work card, cards for trips, a card for our student debt, and cards for our necessary expenses including the baby. With the amount of student debt that I took on to get my Masters and my wife took to get her doctorate, there's always been a line of credit to pay down. Thankfully, we both have good jobs and are pretty frugal, so we tend to eat at home a lot so that we can afford these little trips here and there. 

Moderator: How do you use your travel cards? 

Michael: I have two cards that I use to book flights so I can rack up miles and another card that I use for purchases while we’re there. The card that I use while we’re there is great because of its exchange rates and flat fees with little interest. The other two cards are used primarily for their points programs so we can turn around and take smaller trips or save for what will soon be family vacations. 

Moderator: Interesting. How do their point programs work? 

Michael: Both cards pretty much work the same. The only difference is that I use one for work and one for personal. They're great though! I pay for all of my lodging, flights, rental cars, and public transportation through them and get points back. Both of them have really great incentives, so when you sign up and spend a certain amount within 30 days, you get 70,000 points which are equal $700 in tickets. This works in my favor because I can get two round-trip tickets to Europe for that price. St Louis still has an international airport, and we can always take the Amtrak or Greyhound to Chicago and fly out of O’hare if it makes more sense financially. 

Moderator: Two round-trip tickets for $700 that's a pretty great deal how do you usually find those? 

Michael: I sign up for those deals to hit my inbox based on specific criteria. Typically I'll add a few destinations and put them on my watch list. Because we plan so far ahead if there's anything that comes up in three months at a fantastic price that's too good to pass up I'll often use our points or buy the tickets with one of our credit cards, go on the trip, and have more points for an expensive trip. 

Moderator: How often do you check for alerts? 

Michael: Fairly often, but sometimes they get sent to my spam folder, so I have to go extract them from that folder just to read them. 

Moderator: So to summarize you use your points on bigger-trips and small weekend trips. What do you do for work trips?

Michael: For work trips I usually put them on my card, expense that and rack up points. Honestly, if it wasn't for my job and all the traveling I do for it, we wouldn't be able to take any of these trips. I'm pretty fortunate in that way. 

Moderator: Well I’m glad you were able to travel as much as you have over the last few years. I know the company I’m working for will really value these insights. Thank you for joining me today and congrats again on starting your family. 

Michael: Thanks, I can’t wait to show my kid the world.
