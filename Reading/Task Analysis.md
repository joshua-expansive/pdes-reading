# Task Analysis
Task analysis is going to help you understand how users *currently* do something. Taking the time to do this step before jumping into designs will give you more confidence about your decisions. Task analysis will help you identify the key actions, tools, and mental processes used to complete a goal.

## What is the user's goal?
A **goal** is the primary outcome the user seeks to make a reality. It's the thing you want to help someone accomplish. 

You determine user goals by spending time with them–typically during user interviews. But you can't just ask people to tell you their goals. Sometimes, they aren't aware of their actual goals and deeper needs. If you ask, they will almost certainly give you a confident (wrong) answer. This isn't an insult—we all have blind spots about the tasks we perform every day. Most of the time, we do them automatically without much self-reflection about the goals driving our decisions. 

Goals must be *inferred* from the research data. Properly framing and scoping a user goal requires a bit of finesse. Goals shouldn't be too broad; otherwise, you can't help people attain them. 

`Feel more confident talking to my friends about the books I've read` is a motivation. It's not an outcome you, as the product designer, can promise. 

`Review all my e-book highlights and comments then share them with friends` is a goal that you could design a better way for someone to do. 

`Become a better at-home chef` is a very large goal. You would have trouble finding and improving the key issues. 

`Shop for and cook recipes that challenge me with new ingredients and techniques` is a goal with definable tasks and subtasks.

## What is a supporting task?

###### [Task Analysis: Understanding User Goals and Behavior](https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/process/user-research/task-analysis-ux-with-example/)

Your product's function and behavior must support user goals via tasks. Tasks are the means to the end of achieving the goal. Each task that supports the larger goal can be broken down into sub-tasks. In the example above, the user steps through six tasks to complete their goal: *Shop for and cook a recipe on Pinterest*. Each of the six tasks also has several subtasks.

## Observe Users
The first step in conducting task analysis is to observe the user. Watch how they interact with the product. You can do light usability testing with just one task in mind for users to complete. Look for these things to help you define goals: 
-   **Triggers and Cues**: What gets the user started with their task?
-   **Desired Outcome**: How does a user know that the task is complete?
-   **Knowledge**: When starting the task, what will the users be expected to know? What information is needed to inform or support their decisions? 
-   **Dependencies**: What has to be in place to perform the task? What is dependent on the task being done?  
-   **Artifacts**: As they complete the task, what other tools or information do they use?
-   **Roles and Responsibilities**: Who else is involved? What decisions are they making? 
-   **Errors and Recovery**: How are errors corrected when something goes wrong?
