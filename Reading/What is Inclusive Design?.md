# Inclusive Design
#### Inclusive design: A methodology or mindset that focuses on understanding user diversity to provide equal opportunities and experiences for all persons no matter their circumstances or capabilities.

Inclusive design, like human-centered design, encompasses both accessibility and usability considerations. Accessibility and usability are attributes, goals, or outcomes of a design. In contrast, inclusive design is a methodology or mindset used by designers to consider the full range of human diversity. Inclusive design is deeply rooted in empathy and the value of learning from as many people as possible. Like a human-centered design approach, this is achieved by involving people throughout all stages of the design process, from initial conception, user research, prototyping, and building of products and services. Additionally, you’re also making sure to involve a wide range of people that account for varying backgrounds, ideologies, circumstances, occupations, interests, motivations, and so on. 

An inclusive design approach is always a human-centered design approach, whereas a human-centered design approach may not always be inclusive.

> “Inclusive design doesn’t mean you’re designing one thing for all people. You’re designing a diversity of ways to participate so that everyone has a sense of belonging.” — Susan Goltsman
