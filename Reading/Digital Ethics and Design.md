# Digital Ethics and Design
## Overview
> Getting traction ... to more deeply consider each of our roles in developing responsible tech can sometimes feel like an uphill battle, a full-time job, and uncharted territory all rolled into one. â€“ Ethical Explorer Field Guide

There's no denying that tech ethics is a large topic; there's far more than we can cover in a product design program. Luckily, as with any skill, there are resources and methods to help you integrate design ethics as part of your personal and team-based practices. The good news is that there are a lot of people working to establish better ethical frameworks of decision-making in tech. This is moving the discussion forward and keeping it top-of-mind, but more can certainly be done. As the newest generation of designers, we challenge you to take these ideas, use them, adapt them, and make them better.

## Challenges to practicing ethical design

### Questioning accepted norms is hard

### People feel like they don't have a say

## An ethical mindset
If everyone in tech agreed on what is good and what is bad, design ethics might be a much less complicated topic! According to [Kat Zhou](https://alltechishuman.org/blog/atih-interviews-kat-zhou-on-technology-design-amp-social-justice), a product designer at Spotify, to adopt an ethical mindset means to commit to autonomy, transparency, and safety. Autonomy means keeping users in control by avoiding [[Dark Patterns]] and designing 'opt-in' and 'opt-out' choices. Transparency means that users have a clear understanding of how a product works and what it does with their information. Safety means avoiding emotional manipulation, respecting privacy, and practicing inclusion.
