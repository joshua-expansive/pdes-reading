# Making an emotional connection

When it comes to digital products, people expect more from devices than ever before. They hope to interact the same as they do with people. It’s no longer enough to design products with good functionality and make them usable; it’s equally important to ignite a positive emotional reaction from the user.

## The pyramid of users needs
User’s emotional responses may not be the first thing designers consider when designing products, but it’s what will set their product apart.

###### [Aarron Walter’s pyramid of user needs](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Emotion-Aaron-Walter/dp/1937557006)
This Maslow’s pyramid portrays the hierarchy of user needs. While it’s universally important to ask, “does this product work?” you must also consider the product’s reliability, usability, and pleasure-ability. 

More importantly, the power of emotion in digital products is such that it makes the experience more memorable, and this drives adoption and sometimes creates new user habits. The best digital products strive to evoke a positive emotional reaction.
## How to bake emotions in digital products
#### Emotional reactions
Bake subtle animated effects into interactions that mimic natural human reactions.

This iOS example uses shaking when the use enters an incorrect password. It is simple while being similar to the head-shaking that people use when they want to say “No.” Best of all, it doesn’t require text, and users can easily decipher the meaning.
#### Mood tracker
Capture user moods and integrate that into their experience with your digital product. The current mood of any user will influence their interaction and the content they may want to consume. Attempting to meet them where they are will make a connection well beyond the product’s usability. The following are some examples:

#### Rating for experience
Most surveys presented after interacting with a product feel like an afterthought and look dull without motivating the users. Collecting feedback is essential, but it’s more important to make it worth their while and not look like work. With a bit more thought, you can turn a tedious exercise into an interactive and engaging experience. You don’t need to use some cutting-edge technologies for that. You can use existing UI components (such as sliders), popular emojis, illustrations, and subtle animated effects. The following are some examples:

4. Sub Level Slider by [Yaroslav Zubko](https://dribbble.com/Yar_Z)
It’s possible to take one step further and use gesture-based interactivity to create unexpected behavior.

#### Animoji, AR masks, and contextual AR hints
Designers could utilize a camera to create a new way of expressing emotions for their users — such as AR masks or Animoji. These simple features significantly impact user experience — they allow users to express their personality and keep them coming back.

#### Immersive interactive experiences
Another way to make users emotionally connect to your product is by immersing them in experiences where users can participate in a story and become part of the narrative. Immersive experiences are less about technology and more about storytelling. You don’t have to feel limited by augmented or virtual reality, but instead, focus on where you can get users to empathize.

[The Boat](http://www.sbs.com.au/theboat/) is a perfect example that doesn’t use augmented or virtual reality. It uses parallax scrolling and sound to create a sense of immersion and make for a memorable experience.
