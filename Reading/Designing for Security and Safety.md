# Designing for Security and Safety
The amount of data and personal information being exchanged over the internet today is massive. With that in mind, companies need to be more careful than ever about how they handle that data to protect themselves and their customers. As designers, the need for security and safety for our users and clients needs to be at the forefront of our designs. By being proactive in how we design our products with security in mind, we can minimize the scope of damage done if catastrophe were to strike such as hacks and data breaches.

 One primary challenge for designers is to determine the most appropriate amount of information needed from users to begin with. What information do you need from your user in order to create an experience for the user that feels personal to them, yet adequately protects them in the case of an emergency? One popular framework leveraged by professionals today is the ‘Privacy by Design’ model. 

 Privacy by Design is a methodology we can apply to our designs to ensure that the privacy of individuals is protected by our product. The purpose of this framework is to help designers think ahead to anticipate, manage and potentially prevent any data or privacy issues before we release our product for the end-users consumption. As products are assessed for other aspects of design such as desirability, usability, and viability, designers should also evaluate their products with these 8 principles in mind to determine how effectively they are managing the data and privacy of their users. 

1. **Proactive not reactive**: Taking a high level look at your product and your company's practices. Be mindful of what data you are asking from users and why. What privacy issues can you anticipate and what are the risks associated with them? Knowing the facts ahead of time can help the team better weigh what type of information should be collected and why it is important.  
2.  **Privacy is the default setting**: As you design your product or service, it is best practice to protect personal data automatically versus sharing it with other users or third parties. When privacy is the default setting, the user will not need to take additional steps to protect their data. This also goes a long way in building user confidence and trust.  
3.  **Embed privacy into the design**: Ensure your users that their data is protected when filling in forms and other types of inputs. Consider how transparent your messaging is and give the users the ability to protect their data if they so choose.  
4.  **Avoid trade-offs**:In some situations it may feel as though you can only provide one of the two, security or privacy. Reevaluate your objectives and consider why information is needed and how mission critical it is that your user’s provide that information.  
5.  **End-to-end security**:When evaluating the data you are collecting from users, consider the entire lifecycle it will go through. Once you have collected and processed data sets, how will it be destroyed securely when it is no longer needed? Also consider how that can be communicated clearly and succinctly to your users.  
6.  **Keep it open**: As you get closer to launching your products, you may use a third party product or service to help collect data. Be open and transparent to your users about this and ensure that those third parties are able to be verified if your users want to dig further. It is also best practice to be entirely transparent about what data you are collecting and the purpose of collecting it.  
7.  **Keep it user centered**: The interest of individual users is the top priority for designers when building products. Consider the needs of your users and provide them with controls over their own data usage. They should also be given clear and appropriate notice when any of their privacy settings are changed for any reason.  
8. **Don’t sacrifice privacy for personalization**: More and more products are taking curated approaches to better serve their individual users. However, personalization can come at the expense of privacy as more and more data is collected from users. When evaluating your product for the aforementioned criteria or making design decisions for the product, always opt for user privacy over personalization.
