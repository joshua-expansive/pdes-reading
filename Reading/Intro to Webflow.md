# Intro to Webflow

Webflow is one of the best tools in the industry to build custom websites in a completely visual canvas, with no code. But just because Webflow is a no-code tool doesn't mean it won't allow you to go very deep with layout, animations, CMS, and dynamic content types and interactions. It even includes a hosting network so you can deploy your sites quickly and easily. If you want to see some inspiring work from the Webflow community, spend some time browsing their [showcase of sites here](https://webflow.com/websites/popular#recent). 

We're incredibly excited to partner with Webflow to give our students a 1-year professional account to host their portfolio! We are here to support you as you learn the platform, but we do expect you to take ownership over getting up to speed on the fundamentals. 

Webflow also has one of the best resources for learning their platform that we've ever seen! It's called Webflow University and is free for you to use. In fact, we'd like you to spend some time going through their [Webflow 101](https://university.webflow.com/courses/webflow-101-crash-course) crash course. It's the best way to get up to speed quickly. It should take you about 2 hours to watch the entire course, but it's time well-spent! 

```ad-note
The final two sections, CMS & Dynamic Content and CMS Collection Fields, are not as relevant for building a portfolio. Feel free to skip these until later.
