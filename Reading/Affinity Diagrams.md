# Affinity Diagramming User Interviews
Affinity diagrams create clusters from individual data points that share a relationship or affinity. How to evaluate and interpret the relationship between items should be determined before the session begins. If everyone assesses the items with a different set of criteria (or worse, no criteria), you will end up with a meaningless diagram. Achieving group consensus will be impossible.

## Preparing the data 
If everyone is building with the same size bricks, it’s easier to put them together into a coherent whole. It’s easy to overlook or ignore this step because it takes upfront preparation. Teams are often too eager to start building the house before they check the quality of the bricks. This step requires reviewing your interview transcripts and summarizing each theme from the conversation. An interview that lasted for 45 minutes may have anywhere from 20 to 50 summaries. This step can happen anytime before the synthesis session. 

For the two quotes below, each summary contains a clear and concise statement of the concept the person was trying to communicate.   
> “So in the morning, if I’m trying to limit how much screen time he has, I have to be proactive and getting in front of him before he starts watching TV because then it can turn into a battle to turn the TV off, or to get the routine going.”

**Summary: I try to be proactive about my morning routine, so we avoid battles over watching TV.**

> “Oh, my God, exercise. I mean, I go to the gym, but I do an outdoor boot camp thing. I do it, and I feel so much better afterward. Some nights it’s like a good reset for me. But it’s still just like I didn’t have enough time. But I really like to have those 45 minutes.”

**Summary: I feel like there’s not enough “me” time, even though exercise is a good reset.**

### Agree on summary guidelines
You can come up with summary guidelines that make sense for your team. Here are some to consider:
- Start with the verb or the emotion
- Follow with the key point
- Make sure the summary is perfectly clear
- Speak from the point of view of the user
- If two summaries from the same transcript are very similar, combine them into a new summary
  
If you take the time with this step, you’ll find the affinity session flows much better, and concepts are easier to combine into groups. There is no perfect formula for writing summaries; often, it’s an informed judgment call.

## Grouping the data
This way of diagraming follows the recommendations of authors Hugh Beyer and Karen Holtzblatt as described in [Contextual Design: Design for Life](https://www.elsevier.com/books/contextual-design/holtzblatt/978-0-12-800894-2). They make an essential distinction between top-down classification with pre-determined categories or focusing questions and a bottom-up inductive process that surfaces new insight.  

> The Afﬁnity is built bottom-up. We don’t start with known categories such as “Usability issues” or “Quality.” That would reduce building an Afﬁnity to a sorting task; each note goes in its own bucket, and at the end you know no more than you did before. Instead, we allow the individual notes to suggest grouping they might belong to.

### What is significant for design in each note?
The project focus determines the grouping and interpretation. If two notes share a similar higher-level meaning or key idea, you can group them.

### Group labels are the synthesis revealing new meaning. 
Group labels should not be categorical. Instead, they state the issue that holds all the notes below it together. A good label won’t require someone to read every individual note to understand it.

“Different ways of finding a doctor” is not a good group label. Neither is “How people prefer to watch movies.” Both examples would require you to review every note in its group to learn anything. The label should reveal the important insight for design and be immediately understandable. Instead, these may be better labels for note groupings:
- I care about ratings when I look for a new doctor.
- I want to keep track of how many exercise sessions I’ve completed.
- Travel broadens my worldview and improves me as a person.

## Recommendations
Beyer and Holtzblatt make a few more helpful recommendations when building the affinity diagram.
- **Break down large groups into several smaller ones.** This criterion forces you to do more synthesis reasoning to create group labels.
- **Create a hierarchy of groups by combining two or more groups.** The goal is to push more synthesis and knowledge upwards to the top.
- **Wait as long as possible to create labels.** Once a group has been labeled, it takes on the semblance of finality; people are much less likely to question or change it.
- **Immerse yourself in the life of users by reading the story in the labels.**
