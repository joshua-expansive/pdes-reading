# Part 1 Research 
This project will teach you how to make sense out of unstructured research data. You'll analyze user interview transcripts and then complete a synthesis session to identify insights and areas of opportunity. The outcome of this research will support the launch of a new product that helps parents make the best choice when faced with a big decision about school.
### Background
The client has tasked you with helping them understand how parents decide where to send their children to school. You have inherited interview transcripts from conversations with several parents. Read the following interview transcripts from [OurKids](https://www.ourkids.net/school/choosing-a-school-parent-interviews).

### Research questions
*These questions are not meant to constrain the analysis but rather help with the general thematic inquiry into the data. These are not the only topics of interest. The collected research data should inform the synthesis and problem framing.* 
- What feelings, inner reasoning, guiding principles, and purposes do parents have when choosing a school for their child?
- What are some common thinking styles parents demonstrate when making a school choice?  
- How much time do parents typically spend researching different schools? How many schools do they consider before making a choice?
- What would parents change about the school choice process? 

# Part 2 Prototype
Go from understanding the problem to generating and testing your ideas. You should use a multiplicity of methods to assist with brainstorming and ideation. You'll learn how to prioritize solving problems that create the most good, generate ideas with other designers, build quick prototypes, and do rapid research to inform your final concept recommendation. 
### Requirements
1. The final solution must be as inclusive as possible to a diversity of people's needs and contexts. 
2. The final solution should be a native application for a phone or tablet. 
3. The final prototype should focus on the core value features. Features like onboarding, account set up, etc, are not needed for this proof-of-concept.
