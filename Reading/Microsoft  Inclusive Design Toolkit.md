# Microsoft’s Inclusive Design Toolkit
While we often design with the mindset of finding the best “one size fits all,” more and more companies are starting conversations around designing for “one size fits one.” Microsoft developed a handy [Inclusive Design Toolkit](https://www.microsoft.com/design/inclusive/) that introduces concepts and activities that designers can use in their design process to accommodate a broader range of diversity.

###### [Microsoft Inclusive Design](https://www.microsoft.com/design/inclusive/)

### Recognize exclusion
Designing for inclusivity not only opens up our products and services to more people, it also reflects how people really are. All humans grow and adapt to the world around them and we want our designs to reflect that.
    
### Solve for one, extend to many
Everyone has abilities, and limits to those abilities. Designing for people with permanent disabilities actually results in designs that benefit people universally. Constraints are a beautiful thing.
    
### Learn from diversity
Human beings are the real experts in adapting to diversity. Inclusive design puts people in the center from the very start of the process, and those fresh, diverse perspectives are the key to true insight.

## The Persona Spectrum

###### [Microsoft Inclusive Toolkit](https://www.microsoft.com/design/inclusive/)
Microsoft’s inclusive design toolkit includes a “[Persona Spectrum](https://medium.com/microsoft-design/kill-your-personas-1c332d4908cc)” which illustrates how diverse the needs and motivations of an audience can be based on various scenarios. This is a great tool to get you and your team thinking about the wide range of users with varying circumstances that you may be designing for.

**Permanent:** A person and how they interact is impacted in the long-term.
**Temporary:** A short-term context, like an injury, impacts a person and how they interact.
**Situational:** A circumstance or environment a person is in, like being on an airplane, impacts them and how they interact.
