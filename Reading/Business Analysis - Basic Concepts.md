# Business Analysis: Basic Concepts
Business Analysis is the approach to the problem space from a business perspective. A product designer must understand business requirements, define business objectives, and manage stakeholders' expectations when assessing or providing solutions for a product. This connection helps when designers are proposing solutions that businesses want to employ.

Actual product value comes from understanding where the user needs and business needs coincide. As product designers, you must have empathy and understanding of both.

Typical tools to understand business analysis include:
-   **Domain research** - understanding the specific technology, the processes, and the inner workings of an industry. This includes knowing trends and forecasts in the given domain.
-   **Market and product research -** understanding the product marketability and scope in the industry.
-   **Stakeholder research** - speaking to stakeholders to learn their role and understand their needs, concerns, and their measure of success.
-   **History of the product** - knowing solutions that have been tried before, with success, or failure will help you make educated decisions for future iterations.
-   **Competitive analysis -** seeing and comparing how the business competes with other products in the space.
-   **Constraints** - technology, time, money, and humans available to execute the product design are elements of product success.
