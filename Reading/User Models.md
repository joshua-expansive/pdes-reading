# User Models
Knowing the differences between user modeling strategies will help you decide which ones are most suitable for the project.

## Personas
Personas are the most frequently discussed output for modeling user attitudes and behaviors. As a qualitative and quantitative research product, personas are the most comprehensive in a lineup of user-centered deliverables.

Other artifacts like empathy maps, user profiles, and proto-personas represent smaller output and steps along the way toward fully fleshed-out personas. With this variable and often ambiguous and fictional user modeling landscape, of course, comes criticism. Like all synthesis tools, personas can be misleading or even counterproductive when [made or misused](https://www.uie.com/brainsparks/2007/11/14/crappy-personas-vs-robust-personas/). More than ever, there exist a variety of criticisms against personas or, perhaps, poorly made personas. Alan Cooper, one of the original creators of design personas, has even stated [people misinterpret and misuse personas](https://youtu.be/G7ljzXB40hw?t=702). It's valuable to step back and ask: In what contexts is it helpful to create personas for the project or product? At a minimum, advocates for personas say it is vital to [keep personas updated](https://alistapart.com/article/resurrecting-dead-personas/) and referenced often.

## Proto-personas
You've encountered proto-personas before, also known as provisional personas or lean personas. They are the low-fidelity version of traditional personas; however, unlike conventional personas, they're created based on team and stakeholder assumptions and secondary research, such as web analytics, market research, and competitive analysis.

Proto-personas are a good option when the time or resources needed to conduct extensive user research are lacking. In these cases, they'll serve as placeholders until enough user data is collected to create more formalized, traditional personas. 

While traditional personas take the form of a polished deliverable, proto-personas are typically very simple, possibly even a quick sketch or doodle. Visually portraying them in a lower fidelity can help to emphasize that it's a work in progress and indeed a proto-persona versus a more comprehensive persona.

## User Profiles
A user profile is created by collecting data about the products' active users. The profile may include who they are, what they like, their geographical location, academic and professional background, preferences, opinions, etc. It can be a mix of descriptive data, but statistical data is also valuable to highlight. User profiles are made up of gathered facts and figures, while personas may mix assumptions and data collected. Many times user profiles are included in personas.

## Empathy Maps
Empathy maps help articulate what we know about a particular type of user by externalizing knowledge about users visually and collaboratively to create a shared understanding of the user's needs and insights. Empathy maps provide a glance into who a user is as a whole and are not chronological or sequential. There are four quadrants of a traditional empathy map: Says, Thinks, Does, and Feels with the user at the center.

![[empathymap.png]]
###### Source: \[NNGroup\](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/empathy-mapping/)

- The **Says** quadrant contains what the user says out loud in an interview or usability study. It should ideally include verbatim, direct quotes, and even keywords from user research.
- The **Does** quadrant encloses the actions and behaviors the user takes. From the research, what does the user physically do? How does the user go about doing it? 
- The **Thinks** quadrant captures what the user is thinking throughout the experience. This content comes from qualitative research and reflects the items from the Says and Does quadrants. Because of that, it is possible to have the same or similar content in both Says and Thinks. Here, body mannerisms and other unstated actions can reveal what the user thinks, what occupies the user's thoughts, and what they consider valuable. Aim to understand if the user is unsure, self-conscious, polite, or afraid to tell others something.
- The **Feels** quadrant is the extrapolation of the user's emotional state, often represented as an adjective plus a short sentence for context. An example could be: Impatient: pages load too slowly, and the user sighs in frustration. Like the Thinks quadrant, researchers will understand and translate subtle cues like body language, choice of words, and tone of voice to fill this quadrant. Ask yourself: what worries the user? What makes them excited? How does the user feel about the experience? It sometimes can be worthwhile to insert an image or drawing to demonstrate this quadrant. (Source [nngroup.com\](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/empathy-mapping/))

 After filling the four quadrants, there is an important synthesis phase where the user's actions and behaviors are summed up by outlining the user's needs and insights. This synthesis and summation of the user will aid in product and business decision-making. The user's "needs" should all be verbs tied to activities and desires. If the needs are nouns, this implies you've leaped to defining solutions, a step that is not part of this exercise. The final step of synthesizing insights is about compiling all realizations of the user. What do contradictions in actions or feelings imply? When there is a pattern, what does this mean?

## User Stories
User stories are short statements or abstracts that document users' different needs and motivations, especially goals when interacting with the product. \[User stories are used in Agile\](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-user-stories/) (an iterative approach to product development) to plan features or functionalities.

###### Source: [Manifesto](https://manifesto.co.uk/agile-concepts-user-stories/)

This brief statement focuses on what the user wants to do and how that feature will help. 

`As a <user> I can <feature> so that <benefit>`

It not only establishes who the user is but what they need and why they need it. And just like user profiles, there is generally one overarching user story included in the user persona. More granular user stories are the ones used in project planning and scoping.

## User Scenarios
User Scenarios are concise narratives framing a persona's goal and the process by which they achieve it. It highlights a specific task or goal the user has with the product or looks at the user's interactions with the product holistically and ultimately aid in identifying necessary product requirements. They typically follow the creation of personas.

User Scenarios can be confused with User Stories. Still, it is essentially a development of the user story and can also relate to multiple target users. Scenarios can also be broken down into use cases that describe smaller, more specific tasks. (Source: \[JustinMind\](https://www.justinmind.com/blog/user-personas-scenarios-user-stories-and-storyboards-whats-the-difference/))

User scenarios help guide projects and priorities. When creating one, it's best to use a specific persona as the actor in the scenario. Personas provide additional context and insight about how that particular user might perform the task. [A basic scenario mapping](https://miro.com/templates/scenario-mapping/) includes the user's step, what they would be doing, what they would be thinking, and feeling. Scenario mapping is useful to do fairly early in a project to help define user flows, features, UI design, and even the foundations for usability testing. And because it forces you to think about users and their context, it helps ensure your solutions are grounded in the real world. (Source [NNGroup](https://www.nngroup.com/videos/scenario-mapping/))

## Journey Maps
Journey maps are an elaboration or extension of user scenarios and similarly help teams understand where and how users interact with a product. 

![[JourneyMap.png\]]
###### Source: [NNGroup](https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2020/07/30/nng-cjm.png)

Journey Maps identify pain points, goals, and opportunities to reveal problems worth addressing. Journey maps come in [various styles and presentations](https://blog.uxeria.com/en/10-most-interesting-examples-of-customer-journey-maps/) as they can be used to communicate different types of information in any stage of the design process. As such, there is no standardized template for this type of artifact. The output will be dependent on the needs of the project; however, a successful journey map will consider the following factors:  

- **The User** - Define who is making the journey. Is this the primary or secondary persona?
- **User's Goal** - What is it that they ultimately want to accomplish. 
- **Stages of User Interaction**- With the user and their end goal in mind, identify the stages the user must go through to accomplish the goal. Consider the entire experience and steps that may occur before and after using their product to understand the user's entire journey. In the above example, the user's goal is to switch mobile plans. Some high-level stages of accomplishing that have been identified as define, compare, negotiate, and select. 
- **User Actions** - Define what actions a user will need to complete at each stage in their overall process. In the above example, the users in the "define" stage will review their current mobile plan.
- **User Experience** - The next step is to consider the user experience as users take each of the highlighted actions in the previous step. Provide insight into what the user feels, their needs, and frustrations as users complete each of the previously defined activities. In the above example, this is the quotations along the curved line.
- **Opportunities** - Examining users' frustrations, needs, and feelings, what opportunities have been identified to improve the user experience? This is a good base for starting to decide how to iterate on the product. 

Keep in mind that not all users are the same. Designers may find it helpful to create a journey map focused on the same goal for each user type. Comparing the different journeys may offer a better understanding of which pain points affect most users. This can be incredibly useful when prioritizing which opportunities to tackle first.

## Experience map
Experience maps, though similar, should be seen as a parent to a journey map. A journey map has a specific actor (a singular customer or user of a product) and a specific scenario (of a product or service). An experience map is broader on both accounts — a generic human undergoing a general human experience. The experience map is agnostic of a specific business or product. It's used for understanding a general human behavior; in contrast, a customer journey map is specific and focused on a particular business or product.
