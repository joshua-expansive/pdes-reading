# Project 3 - Biotech Visual Identity

## Overview
For this project, you will create the foundational elements of a visual design system. The client is developing a brand and digital product concept and requires exploratory visual research and early conceptual designs. The final deliverable is a style tile and visual competitive analysis that the client can use to further develop their brand and product concept.

1.  Visual Competitive Analysis 
2. Two Style Tiles
## Background

The client is a multi-disciplinary team of researchers who are focused on developing transformative gene-based medicines for serious human diseases. Their cellular therapies are able to isolate the genetic causes of certain diseases, and in some instances, repair them. They use the gene-editing technology [CRISPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR) to develop gene-based medicines and therapies. 

The client wants to develop a suite of digital products, including an app, a website, press kits, and branded merchandise. By creating and testing style tiles, you will help the client establish a foundational visual identify. 
### Mission statement and values
> Transforming lives of people with severe diseases by developing curative genome editing treatments

**Explore**: We are willing to explore with unbounded potential and stay open to ideas. We stay curious and push boundaries. Explore means making new maps where none exist.

**Courageous**: We are willing to create a better future buy defying the status quo. Using imagination and creativity to develop new ways. 

**Transparent**: Genome editing represents a fast-moving, potentially disruptive technology that evokes both excitement and curiosity. We believe it is a part of our responsibility as a company using this promising technology to be transparent about our science and to engage responsibly with the communities for whom we aim to make medicines. 

**Authentic**: We are optimistic about our work but there is still much to be learned. We seek opportunities to learn from the communities we create treatments for. Their voices must be heard in our decision making and research. 

## Style Tiles
The client will need to develop a design system that could potentially be used for any digital product or service. Therefore, the style tiles you deliver do not need to be comprehensive, only suggestive. It would not be possible to represent everything, so be selective and strategic in what you decide to show. Your goal is to help the client imagine what these future products *could* look like, so the style tile only needs to hint at a conceptual direction. 

### Examples
Below are three conceptual design directions for a digital product. The first style tile leans more towards a website or web app, the second style tile does a better job of staying device-agnostic, while the third skews toward a mobile design. But even though two of the style tiles hint more strongly toward a certain device, they decouple the visual concept enough that you can still imagine the concept on a different device.
