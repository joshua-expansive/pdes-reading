# Three Types of Product Flows
Designers often want to communicate the steps in a process, decision points and outcomes, or just change over time. Flows can show complicated processes with a few basic shapes, arrows, and labels. 

How do you know what style of flow to choose for a project? As with most things in design, you should define *why* you need to create a flow, and *who* will be viewing it
- What do you need to learn? How things are? How things should be? 
- What decisions are dependent on the outcome of the flow? 
- Who is the 'actor' in the flow? The user? The system? Both?
- At what stage of the process are you? If early, there may be no need to represent the interface visually. 
- What level of abstraction and detail is helpful to communicate? 

Flows can help us think, decide, define, and communicate the information architecture of a service or product. 

## Flow charts

Some flows can become highly complex when they outline all the possible paths to accomplish a task. Flows charts are a visual representation of the sequence of steps and decisions needed to perform tasks. The term product flow is better suited for flows that include decision options and the respective flow for each user decision. This flow chart leverages specific shapes to indicate what a user sees, what they do, system feedback, and where they go next. Most flow charts include a legend.

## Task flows

Task flow diagrams are an outline of a single task with a common entry point and without multiple branches or paths for the user. The purpose of this flow is to define the ideal progression of interfaces or interactions a user would experience in accomplishing the one task and are typically created with a defined start and end point for the task in mind. It should be noted that some companies use the term to mean more than a single task but more to allow the user to accomplish a single goal, which may sometimes entail more than a single task.

###### [Overflow.io Examples](https://overflow.io/examples/#early-stage-ideation)

Wireflows show the concept using basic undeveloped wireframes to create a visual outline of what a user may experience trying to accomplish a task. It is essentially a task flow with more fidelity in each step. Create a wireflow to define the content and information for a series of screens and how it must be presented to the user.
