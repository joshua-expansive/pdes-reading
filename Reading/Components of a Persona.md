# Components of a Persona

Personas often include a mix of demographics and behavioral patterns based on user research. Ultimately, designers will need to determine the components that are best supported by research and provide meaningful context and understanding of the target audience.

## User type and fictional name
This is basic background information about your audience. We want these personas to feel like they’re about real people. By providing a name, a photo, and other personally identifying information, we can bring these personas to life. The information that we like to collect includes: Name, Gender, Age, Occupation/Company, Location, Photo.

Example: *Claudia, 33 years old, HR Manager at American Express, makes $105,000/yr, and lives in Jersey City, NJ*

## Description and scenario
The description provides context about what the person cares about or focuses on. We need to know this in order to understand how the item we’re designing (website, product, etc) fits into their larger experience).

Example: *Claudia works for American Express in a 9-5 job and has a robust social life after work. Weeknights and weekends are about good meals cooked at home with her partner, Joe. Joe and Claudia love to entertain and host, and their life revolves around making memories with with friends and family, going out with coworkers for happy hours, and gathering with family.*

## Motivation
This brief explanation of what’s driving the audience’s actions and choices help you understand why your audience does what they do with your organization.

Example: _Claudia cares a lot about how her friends and family perceive her. Her love language is gifting, and acts of service. Even though Claudia eats and drinks out often, selecting a nice wine to pair with her elaborate dinners, intimidates her. She often wishes someone just told her what to buy and made her recommendations based on what she's cooking/serving. When she needs to get a bottle of wine as a hostess gift, the need to impress is even more intense and she desperately wants to show she cares._ 

## Main quote
A compelling quote that summarizes what this person’s immediate needs or perspective is often the most memorable. These elements make the persona more human and give a greater sense of who you’re designing for. Ideally these are quotes that we can pull from our audience research, especially interviews. These quotes may answer questions such as what does your audience want, questions they have, or any opinions they may have about your organization/website, etc.

Example: _“Do I have to pretend I know what I am talking about and buy the wrong wine, or buy the right one and make a good impression?”_

## Goals and needs
By including the top three to five things the user needs to accomplish, you’ll be able to know if and how your user is successful.

Example: _Claudia wants to make buying wine less of a chore, and more enjoyable. She doesn't want to feel intimidated, stay within her budget, and get something that tastes pairs well with food and makes an impression. Along the way, if she can educate herself without the pressure, it would be an added bonus._

## Frustrations and painpoints
By including the top three to five worries that this user has, you’ll know what your user’s potential blockers are.

Example: _Claudia wastes hours researching the right type of wine only to get frustrated trying to source it. Often times, she feels embrasssed with the pressure to impress, ends up spending lots of money for a wine that doesn't taste right. Learning about and pretending to know all about wine feels exhausting and a waste of energy. She needs some help without the judgement._

## Behavior and habits
By providing context of the user behaviors, and habits, you can design a solution that fits within their lifestyle, and the chance of them adapting your solution is higher.

Example: _Claudia likes to browse her local wine shop on her way home after visiting the farmer's market and picking up groceries, on Thursday and Friday nights. It gets her in the mood for the weekend of meals shared with friends and family, and date night with her partner. Sometimes, her partner and her share a list of pickups and divvy up their shopping list. They communicate via text messaging to keep track._

## Attitudes and opinions
Providing your user’s feelings allows you to empathize with the audience and anticipate their attitude.

Example: _Claudia is savvy, wordly and kind. She takes her frienships, amd relationships seriously. Her motto is to live life daily, and make memories. It just so happens that most of the memories are made around the kitchen table._

## Likes and hobbies
Likes and Hobbies provide more color and context to the user's day to day and their overall personality.

Example: _“Hosting theme nights is Claudia's superpower. She will plan meals around global events, cultural happenings, and look for things to celebrate from all cultures. Her most memorable was the Casino Night dinner party she hosted two months ago.”_

## Additional information
Personas vary widely depending on what information you deem to be important or relevant to your business/stakeholder. Here are a few other things we may include in our personas:
- Tech Savviness / Internet Usage
- Familiarity with Your Brand
- Brands Owned and Used
- Social Media Usage
- Favorite Apps
- Communication Preferences
- Personality Traits
- Skills
- Background / Experience
