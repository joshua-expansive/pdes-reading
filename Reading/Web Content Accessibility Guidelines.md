### Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) maintains a set of internationally recognized guidelines—[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/))—that provide developers, designers, and all interested parties with accessibility standards. There are three conformance levels: A is the lowest; AA is moderate and most used; AAA is the most strict. These guidelines can seem intimidating even to seasoned users; a good place to start building your knowledge is with the W3C’s [four principles of accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/intro#understanding-the-four-principles-of-accessibility):

- **Perceivable**: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
- **Operable**: User interface components and navigation must be operable.
- **Understandable**: Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.
- **Robust**: Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.
