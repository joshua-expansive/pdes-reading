# Project Process Documentation

## Why document everything?
Hiring managers/recruiters are scanning for evidence that you know your stuff. When you walk into an interview, they’ll ask you to present 2 or 3 of your best works and deep dive into each piece.

Project process documentation allows you to insert details of your projects from start to finish, show your process, go beyond polished images, provide context to viewers and your future self. They are about documenting and processing what u learned in each thing and how that got you to the next.

## What to document?
Begin with a basic structure for your PPD, which may include:
	- **Overview:**
		Quick summary of the company/product/prompt providing crucial context - the what
	- **Problem space:**
		Identify the problem/broad goal of the project. Perhaps add the desired outcome - the why
	- **Users/Audience:**
		Include any/all user research conducted or provided - the who
	- **Roles and Responsibilities:**
		Describe “When” you did the project, the duration, your specific role(s), platform. Having this information near the beginning allows the audience to continue reading with maximum context, while understanding your personal contribution to the project.
	- **Scope and Constraints:**
		Budget, timeline, possible limitations, etc.
	- **Process:**
		This is the meat of your case study. The ENTIRE process, including key pieces of research info like screener results, number of user interviews, etc. Your process, the tools, the deliverables, etc. - the how.
	- **Outcomes and Results:**
		How did it end? Projects are NEVER finished, so where did you leave off? What went right and wrong. What impact did this have? Show the end wireframes, or prototype, if applicable.
		
A completed project must include assets:
- photos of you actually doing the work, photos of the deliverables, users in interview, etc.
- deliverables like user interview scripts, personas, wireframes, prototypes, journey maps, other artifacts.
- *(optional)* screenshots of workshops, sketches, brainstorming, etc.
