# Understanding Accessibility
In the design world, accessibility is a vast subject that often gets boiled down to a simple set of requirements that designers go through the motions to follow as they design—almost like a checklist, rather than an inclusive design process with innovative and empathetic thought. Accessibility requirements are essential and should be upheld by designers; however, they are not the end of accessible design. With increasing awareness around the importance of inclusion and accessibility in tech, designers must learn how to integrate more inclusive design approaches into their daily practice.

## Accessibility has different considerations than inclusive design
The terms inclusive and accessible are sometimes used interchangeably. There is some overlap between inclusive design and accessible design, but they are distinct from one another. 

Accessibility is focused on the goal or _outcome_ of a design, ensuring that it provides the same opportunity and experience to people no matter their capability or circumstance. Inclusive design focuses on learning from, and designing for, all human diversity. 

Accessibility is not exclusive to those who are hearing, visually, or learning impaired. The ideology of designing for accessibility is often translated as “design for all.” [Microsoft’s inclusive design toolkit](https://www.microsoft.com/design/inclusive/) even goes on to define a “persona spectrum” that accounts for permanent, temporary, and situational scenarios. When creating personas, user scenarios, and use cases, consider a wide range of user types, needs, and contexts.
