# Type Classifications 
Type classification is a system of organizing typefaces into categories, making it easier to identify and pair typefaces: serif, sans serif, script, monospaced and display.

**Serif typefaces** are defined by a serif (i.e., a small shape or projection) added to the beginning or end of a stroke. Because of serifs’ visual distinction, serif typefaces improve legibility and are often used for long lines of text, such as body text.
-   Common serif typefaces include: Times New Roman, Baskerville, and Garamond.
-   Common subclassifications of serif typefaces include Old-style, Slab serif, Transitional, and Didone or Neoclassical.

**Sans-serif typefaces** are defined by the lack of a serif. Sans-serif typefaces are commonly used for displaying digital text since it’s legible even on lower-resolution screens.
-   Common sans serif typefaces include: Helvetica, Arial, and Futura
-   Common subclassifications of sans serif typefaces include Grotesque, Neo-grotesque, Humanist, and Geometric.

**Script typefaces** are a distinct display typeface style based on the varied and fluid strokes modeled after handwriting. The particular technical style is generally not used for long-form body text but instead more often for headers.
-   Common script typefaces include: Coronet, Zapfino and Alex Brush
-   Common subclassifications of script typefaces include: Gothic, Calligraphic, Casual, and Elegant

**Monospaced** are utilitarian typefaces that are perfectly spaced fixed-pitch, fixed-width, each letter and character occupying the same amount of horizontal space. They are popular because of their readability of their letters, special characters, and words, especially in computer screens and programming.
-   Common monospaced typefaces include: Courier, Fixedsys, and Menlo.
-   Common subclassifications of monospaced typefaces include Humanist, Typewriter, Techno, and Industrial.

**Display** typefaces can be ornate, decorative, and attention-grabbing, aiming to entice the viewer but should be leveraged strategically and sparingly.
-   Common display typefaces include: Bauhaus, Forte and Cooper Black
-   Common subclassifications of display typefaces include Serif, San Serif, Ornate, Period, Wood, Script, Blackletter, and Decorative.
