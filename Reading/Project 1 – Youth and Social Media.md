![|800](https://prodesigncurriculum.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/project-header.png)
## Overview
This project is all about teaching you how to collect the right research data when you need to understand how people think, feel, and act.  

*Your job is to create the documents and artifacts that a product designer would need to fulfill the research strategy.*
 
You won't need to write anything from scratch as we've given you a template for each deliverable. A research guide is provided. 

## Project deliverables 
- Conduct and present domain research 
- Write a survey
- Finish a user interview guide and script

The goal of this research is to gain a better understanding of the challenges youth face with social media. The insights will contribute to a future project aimed at elevating supportive and healthy online interactions as well as identify opportunities for further research. 

### Audience discovery
Early exploratory research helps you define an audience who you are interested in solving a problem for. In this project, the audience is very broad. During the course of the research, you'll define the behavioral audience segment you intend to survey and interview. 

### Research questions
- What are situations that are positive on social media? What are situations that are negative?
- How would youth re-imagine social media? What would they change? What would they keep?
- What health risks are associated with social media use and being a youth?
- What strategies do youth use to find supportive, healthy, and safe spaces on social media? When and how to they take breaks from social media?
- How in control do youth feel over what they see?
