# Grid Layout
Making sure your designs are responsive can quickly begin to feel like a daunting task. After all, how is it possible to account for every single device and environment? This is where grid systems can quickly become a designer’s best friend. 

Grids are a series of horizontal and vertical lines used to arrange layouts and build compositions across different devices. A grid system acts as guidelines for designers to make more effective decisions related to the placement, spacing, and scale of elements. It emphasizes the relationship of elements on a page and how their position or size can impact one another. Because grid systems create patterns and uniformity in designs, they’re also a great collaboration and communication tool.

An important part of learning to use a grid system is also learning how to work creatively within it. After all, grids are most effective when considered guidelines and not hard and fast rules. One example of doing this is learning when it’s appropriate to “break the grid”. The concept of breaking the grid refers to when a designer makes a conscious decision to exercise creative liberties within grid system. This is usually done in order to create a point of interest or to emphasize an element within a design. While this can be an effective way to define and differentiate a design, it can also be very tricky to get right. So before trying to experiment, it’s important to have a solid understanding of how a grid works.

Grids are commonly made up of the following components: **columns**, **gutters**, and **margins**. [Google Material Design](https://material.io/) does a great job visualizing these three components.
### Columns

Columns are used to define the area where content will be laid out on a screen. The number of columns used within a grid can vary and is usually defined by responsive breakpoints. Typically, when designing for multiple platforms, the width of the column stays the same while the number of columns used across platforms changes. For example, it’s common to use a 12-column grid for desktop, an 8-column grid for tablet, and a 4-column grid for mobile. A common column width is 60-80px.
### Gutters

Gutters, also known as alleys, refer to the space between columns and are leveraged to separate content on a screen. They ensure content doesn’t look overly cluttered on a screen by enforcing necessary whitespace throughout a design. Gutters can either be a fixed width across breakpoint ranges or they can adapt to each breakpoint for a more customized structure. Adapting the width is good when less or more whitespace is needed between columns to better accommodate for specific needs. For example, you might utilize smaller gutters on a screen to establish a visual relationship amongst related content.  A common gutter width is 20px.
### Margins

###### [Material.io Responsive Layout Grid](https://material.io/design/layout/responsive-layout-grid.html#columns-gutters-margins)

Margins refer to the area of whitespace that defines the perimeter of a screen and separates content from the edges of the screen. Margins are also referred to as “outside gutters”. A common margin width is 20-30px and vary depending on the breakpoint. Similar to gutters, adjusting margin size based on the device and breakpoint size can ensure an appropriate amount of whitespace across platforms.
