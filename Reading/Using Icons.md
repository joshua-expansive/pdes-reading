# Icons As Part Of A Great User Experience

Icons express objects, actions, and ideas and are an essential part of many user interfaces. They have many benefits when used correctly and many times enhance the visual aesthetic. 
## Benefits of using icons
- Icons save screen real estate. Text labels take more space than icons.
- Icons are part of a design pattern that is already familiar to the user.
- Icons share a universal language. For example, the email icon works cross-culturally in various parts of the world.
- Icons guide users to where they need to go, typically large enough to be good targets to be clicked or touched.

There are core usability problems created when icons are misused. Icons could be ambiguous when not understood universally, unusable when small and hard to read, and confusing when hard to recognize. All of these lead to core usability problems and create visual noise.
## Types of icons
### Universal icons
Universal icons are rare but most effective.

###### [Icons 8](https://icons8.com/icons#styles)

The symbols for home, printing, searching, and the shopping cart are some of the very few universal icons that enjoy universal recognition from users.
### Icons with conflicting meaning
Some icons are hard to interpret because they have contradictory meanings. This confuses users and impacts the user’s understanding of the expected outcome.

The heart and the star are excellent examples. Not only does the functionality associated with these icons vary from app to app, but these two icons compete with each other.

Other popular icons have multiple meanings:

### Unique icons
When icons are used for anything abstract, they generally are not strong visual representations. Users cannot bring their former understanding and have to learn to associate a meaning to these icons and therefore many of the benefits of icons become moot. Another con is that first-time users tend to avoid interface elements that they don’t understand or recognize.

###### [Apple](https://developer.apple.com/game-center/)
Apple’s icon for its Game Center app, a group of colorful circles, has an abstract relation to gaming, but one that isn’t easy conveyed.

###### This abstract google icon had users looking for their google calendar and caused a lot of confusion and frustration.

**Testing icons** in interfaces with real users is crucial. Other times, we can follow best practices to ensure clarity and recognition
## Usability and Clarity
### Using labels
Icons can save space by reducing text, but at the price of recognition. Text labels can dramatically increase the usability. Icons need to set clear expectations for users _before_ they click or tap on them so they aren't intimidated by them. For example, the bottom tab bar icons might confuse first-time Android users.

On the other hand, labeled icons are much more likely to be used.

### Using icons alone
Labels help with clarity for users not familiar with the icons. However, experienced users might regard an interface with text labels everywhere to be cluttered. Icons alone will suffice when at least [two of the following three conditions](http://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/1795/when-to-use-icons-vs-icons-with-text-vs-just-text-links) are met:
-   space is very limited (i.e. too small for text alone)
-   the icons are standardized (e.g. they are universal)
-   the icons represent objects with strong physical analogs or visual attributes (e.g. a red rectangle to set the page’s background as red)
When in doubt, don't use an icon if its meaning isn’t 100% clear or if it requires effort from the user. When in doubt, skip the icon and use simple text label. If you want to keep the visual or aesthetic advantages of using icons, you can label your icon.
