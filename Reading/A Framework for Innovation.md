# A Framework for Innovation
## What do we mean by "framework"?
When we say _framework_, we mean it in the architectural sense, as a supporting structure for doing work. Frameworks come in all shapes and sizes, and some are better than others.
-   Frameworks may define a process or set of processes.
-   They may define new concepts, models, and methods.

A design framework may become formalized and accepted by the design and tech community when enough people have used it with repeated success. People may begin writing articles, creating guides and resources, and extending the framework with new methods. Some frameworks even have dedicated yearly conferences.

### Is design thinking a framework?
Yes, it's one of the most recognizable frameworks, thanks to IDEO's popularity. [They didn't invent it](https://designthinking.ideo.com/history)—there's no single definition of design thinking—but they made it popular to use. It's an easy framework for anyone to use, and that is both its strength and its weakness. The fact that non-designers can use design thinking has contributed to its wholesale adoption by many companies. But its ease of use has also lulled many teams into thinking they can circumvent the skills and craft of a trained designer.

A mixture of design thinking ingredients exists at most of today's technology companies. And many institutions are extending the realm of design thinking by adapting it for specific domains.

## Design thinking prioritizes human needs
The phrase _human-centered design_ means that spending time with the people you are designing for is central to solving problems. To have a real impact, you need to understand people's perspectives and context deeply. Immersing yourself in your users' world opens up new creative possibilities by generating empathy and understanding.

Products and services are often designed with only business goals and technological constraints in mind. While these are undoubtedly significant factors, this approach often comes at the expense of the end user. Design thinking emphasizes the importance of creating more hands-on touchpoints with actual users to understand their needs better and determine which solution(s) will meet these needs. This enforces the idea that designing with the beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors of the end user in mind instead of trying to adjust user behaviors will result in more efficient and enjoyable user experiences, improving overall profitability and customer satisfaction.

## Design thinking is a creative process for innovation
It uses an experimental and iterative process of divergence and convergence to solve problems and innovate. By embracing ambiguity at the beginning of the process, we explore lots of possibilities. As designers, we need the creative confidence that comes from learning from failure. Design thinking uses multiple rounds of experimentation and user feedback so we can refine and improve our designs.

### Desirable, Feasible, Viable
Design thinking points to the intersection of **Desirable** from a human point of view, what is **Feasible** with current technology, and **Viable** for the business to sustain itself by making money. Looking through each lens, and balancing the three considerations, is more likely to lead to sustainable solutions that create real impact.

## Design thinking uses many methods
There are hundreds of methods that fall under the purview of design thinking, and designers create new ones all the time. Most methods you use will support one of the key design activity categories below. 
- Problem framing
- In-depth user interviews
- Sensemaking and need-finding with analysis and synthesis
- Divergent ideation and experimentation
- Critique 
- Iterate by testing with users

## The benefits of design thinking
While the main appeal of design thinking is putting the actual users at the heart of the problem-solving and decision-making process, there are also many other benefits to leveraging it in your workflow.
- Bridges the gap between business goals, technology constraints, and human needs to create more holistic solutions. It takes into account each of these areas to deliver products and services that people need and desire.
- Encourages collaboration by breaking down design philosophies, concepts, and tools into a digestible framework for use by designers and non-designers alike. It establishes a shared understanding and language that creates more opportunities for cross-disciplinary collaboration.
- Embraces ambiguity by establishing a dynamic framework that is still useful even when there are many unknown variables. When leveraged correctly, it provides a sense of direction while allowing for flexibility to adapt to projects' varying needs.
- Sparks innovation by constantly questioning and challenging assumptions to identify alternative strategies and solutions. It encourages the practice of constant experimentation, iteration, and adaptability.
