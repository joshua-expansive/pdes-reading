# What is Information Architecture?

## Defining IA
Nailing down a good definition of IA is a little bit like trying to define the word 'design.' The answer depends on who you ask and when you ask them. I like Dan Ramsden's definition–he's the creative director of the BBC. 

> Information architecture is the set of relationships that generate the coherence which turns the “parts” into the “whole”. It is also the consideration of how that whole will relate and function within the “next biggest context(s)” which contain it.

I'm going to break that definition into three parts and examine them:
1. Set of relationships
2. Generate coherence/parts into the whole
3. How the whole functions within the next biggest context

### Set of relationships
Here's an image of books on my bookshelf. They aren't in any particular order or grouping. Right now, the only relationships they have to each other is 1) they are all owned by me, 2) they all sit on the same shelf, 3) they are all books. Now, whether or not these existing relationships are *meaningful* or *helpful* depends on the context we mean. If there were books from the library on this shelf, then the relationship "owned by me" becomes meaningful.

Now I'll make a list of some different ways I might possibly arrange (architect) the books.
1. Alphabetically (by title or author)
2. By physical attributes (height, color, number of pages)
3. By subject
4. By time it takes to read
5. Purchase price, least expensive to most

How I choose to arrange the books impacts the utility of being able to find the book I want quickly. BUT that assumes my *intention* is to find books quickly. Maybe my intention is to scan every title and pick randomly for serendipity. If I group by subject, I'm forced to consider whether or not I'm interested in that subject before reading the titles within the group. So which intentions do I want to optimize for and why? 

In essence, this is IA work–intentional design choices about object relationships in order to optimize for a set of intentions or purposes. Or said another way, rearranging information creates **new** information. 

### Coherence which turns the "parts" into a "whole"
Information Architecture always exists, is always created–just not intentionally. When IA is not considered, researched, designed, and tested you run a good chance of undermining the message or utility of your designs. With the books, the parts are the individual books. The whole is how well their arrangement matches my mental model and how well it fits a larger context. It wouldn't make much sense to arrange one shelf by title and another shelf by author, and a third shelf by color. It wouldn't be coherent to anyone else trying to find a book. 

**Coherence** means that the "rules" of how information is organized are clear. It's easy to see the "whole." Interestingly, this is also how the [[Gestalt Principles]] function in visual design, as an organized whole that is perceived as more than the sum of its parts. 

### How the whole functions within the next biggest context
The concept of coherence extends information architecture into the next biggest context. If I order a drink from the Starbucks website, it should be easy to find my order from the Starbucks app, then pay for that order with a digital Starbucks gift card someone sent me via email. The reason I can do this so easily and quickly is because the designers use a coherent information architecture. The digital navigation, hierarchy, and terminology work well across all three contexts. 

> Information architecture is the only field I’m aware of that is concerned with the _structural integrity of meaning across contexts_. —[Jorge Jarango](https://jarango.com)

Information architecture is the art and science of organizing and labeling information to make it findable and understandable. For digital spaces like websites, intranets, online communities, and software, IA organizes and presents information to support usability. In nearly every interaction with a digital product, users are seeking information in one form or another. As designers, we must continually ask ourselves how to help them access that information as easily as possible.

## IA is vital for the user experience
It allows users to navigate websites and apps easily, find the information they are looking for faster, and complete their intended tasks with less confusion and frustration. Like a real-world architect, you're planning the informational "space" where people will dwell, be it in digital or real life.

## IA delivers better results for business goals
When information is easy to find, and the navigation matches users' mental models, it improves the metrics that businesses care about the most. For instance, conversion rate (new visitors making their first purchase) and retention rate (existing user making another purchase) for e-commerce websites, dropoff rate for businesses who want their users to finish specific processes. Good IA can save the company both time and money, which they would have spent fixing and improving.

## IA considerations
-   **Structure and Organization** is about how information is categorized, classified, and bundled.
-   **Labeling systems** is how information gets represented with terminology appropriate for the intended audience.
-   **Navigation systems** are how users browse, move through, and find information.
-   **Search systems** support information-seeking behavior.
