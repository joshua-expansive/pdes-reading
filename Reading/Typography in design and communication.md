# Typography in Design and Communication

Good product design has to communicate its purpose clearly. Typography helps deliver content and information to people in a manner that doesn't overwhelm or confuse them. Even though mastering typography skills takes time and practice, these typography design principles are used to create a great user experience and are an excellent place to start.


## Be careful when pairing multiple fonts
1. Use 2-3 typefaces at the most in a given design project to keep it uncluttered. You can pair serif fonts with sans-serif fonts, or use decorative or display fonts for an attention-grabbing headline, but never for main-body text where readibility is essential.  
2. Start by selecting a typeface for your body text. Use the bold or italics of the body copy font to add small amounts of emphasis. Select a typeface for headlines only after you are confident with a typeface choice for body text.
3. Use the following tools to make sure your selected fonts work well together:

## Use typography to convey hierarchy
Hierarchy in typography allows the viewer to consume and comprehend information fast. Organize information according to priority, and assign them a style (h1 = headline, h2 = subhead, h3 = body copy, etc.). Use variation in scale, typeface, weight and color, you can group like information and convey a path to reading the most important thing first.

After selecting a font for body copy and use other weights of the font family and different sizes for captions, subheadings, and other design elements. Remember that serif fonts are easier on the eye in print, while sans-serif fonts are better for web/digital use.
## Type Guidelines: 
1. **Choose the appropriate size.** Start with choosing a size for the body copy, and then go up and down from there. A general rule of thumb is:
-   For desktops: Use [16 px font or higher](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/10/07/16-pixels-body-copy-anything-less-costly-mistake/) for body text. It’s not too big, and it’s comfortable to read.
-   For iOS devices: Minimum 11 pts
-   For Android: Recommended size is 12-14 sp
2. Choose a second display font for headlines or titles.
3. **Avoid All-caps.** Never use All-caps in text blocks longer than one line of text. It's a lot harder to read and understand when compared to using lower-case.

	High shape contrast in lower case or title case is easier to recognize for viewers when compared to capitalized text.
3. **Use ample leading.** By increasing the vertical white space between lines of text, readability is improved significantly. As a rule of thumb, leading should be about 30% more than the character height.
4. **Avoid large blocks of text.** The visual perception of large blocks on ongoing text is that it's difficulat to focus on, hard to read, and generally feels like work.
5. **Apply type consistency.** Once you decide on your typefaces, and their application, use it consistently. This will help give a polished look and make finding information/content easier.
6. **Use color in type to convey hierarchy.** Warm colors pop on screen and cool colors recede to allow the viewer to process type as primary or secondary.
7. **Use alignment thoughtfully.** Ensure all elements of typography are in relation with each other. When stacking content, align body text with headline, which aligns with image or logo above that.

	Consider left alignment to be the safest, best choice, followed by right alignment to create interest. Avoid over-using center alignment as it looks messy, imbalanced, and amateur. 
8. **Use whitespace effectively** Cluttered areas of type will cause confusion and take away from effective communication. Use whitespace (or negative space) to draw the viewer in and imply that whatever is within the large field of empty space must be important.
