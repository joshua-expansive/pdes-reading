# Prototyping Basics
>“They slow us down to speed us up. By taking the time to prototype our ideas, we avoid costly mistakes such as becoming too complex too early and sticking with a weak idea for too long.”  — Tim Brown, CEO & President of IDEO

Prototyping falls into the second diamond of the Framework for Innovation. It is often followed by “testing” and preceded by “ideation.” Prototyping is the process of creating an interactive version of a design concept (a prototype) to be used for testing, validating, or communicating to team members. By being able to test designs and ideas with users or stakeholders early, it can save time and resources and help the business understand where to take the product or offerings. 

Prototypes can be different levels of polish: paper-based prototypes or high-fidelity prototypes that showcase final visual designs and interactions. Designers use low-fidelity prototypes to validate and test with users in the beginning stage of a project. Designers use high-fidelity prototypes to test visual considerations and usability. And to communicate final designs and interactions to a development team. 

Regardless of how it’s created, the level of fidelity, or the amount of functionality presented, prototypes aim to capture the design or solution as simple as possible to allow for testing and communication.

## Eight Principles of Prototyping by Todd Zaki Warfel
###### Source: [Prototyping: A Practitioner's Guide](https://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/prototyping/). 
1.  Understand the audience and intent.
2.  Plan a little—prototype the rest: spend some time on planning designs and solutions but really focusing time on testing and validating.
3.  Set expectations: what are the goals for the prototype?
4.  You can sketch: often prototypes can be done quickly on paper.
5.  It's a prototype—not the Mona Lisa.
6.  If you can't make it, fake it.
7.  Prototype only what you need.
8.  Reduce risk—prototype early and often.
