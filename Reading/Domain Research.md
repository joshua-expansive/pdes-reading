# Domain Research

Before initiating user research, you must understand the product space where your product or service resides. This entails conducting preliminary domain research to help understand the existing product/service in its proposed environment. 

**Use it and experience it yourself.** The easiest place to start domain research is by understanding the existing product or service. For example, if your product lives in retail banking, you need to familiarize yourself with fund transfers, currency conversions, and other everyday transactions in retail banking

**Understand the market segment your product serves.** Start with a google search.
- Research changing technologies and approaches in the marketplace.
- Identify the target audience for the product/service,
- Identify an opportunity to target a subset of the audience specifically.

**Gather Metrics.** 
- Look up hard data if readily available: customer churn rate, retention rate, recurring revenue, product performance, web traffic sources, etc.
- Look for early adopter feedback, or run a beta launch to collect this feedback.
- Look to social media to see social sentiment (praise and compliments) re: the marketplace the product will reside in.

**Perform a Competitive Analysis.** Understand the strengths and weaknesses of your competitors, their user group (target users), and potential (development) in the market
