# Design Ethics
In your design career, you’ll have the opportunity to work on various exciting and complex products, services, and experiences. And while it’s easy to get wrapped up in the excitement of new projects, you shouldn’t lose sight of the impact that design can have on people, cultures, and the environment. Many design practices (like behavioral design, persuasive design, and habit design) rely on targeting people’s emotions, behaviors, and motivations, which leaves a lot of ambiguity in ethical boundaries. Add to this ambiguity the daily emerging technologies (artificial intelligence, mass data collection, advanced algorithms, connected devices, robotics, etc.) that are reshaping human values, ethics, and privacy infringement issues. As technologies and design practices continue to grow, designers can expect to find themselves at an ethical crossroads. Now, more than ever, designers need to develop their sense of design ethics and values to bring to the table.

## Designers have an obligation to responsible design
Ethics, or moral philosophy, has long been theorized, studied, and debated throughout recorded history, beginning with the Greek philosophers. According to [Merriam Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ethic), ethics is “the discipline dealing with what is good and bad and with moral duty and obligation.” Ethics stands apart from other fields of study because it isn’t rooted in factual knowledge or data: What might be “good” or “bad” for one person may be entirely different for another. It’s challenging to create a set of ethical standards that defines “unethical” versus “ethical.” 

Design ethics is explicitly associated with the sense of moral duty and obligation designers have to create responsible designs. [Chris Kiess](https://uxpamagazine.org/building-an-ethics-framework-for-ux-design/) identifies three categories of design ethics. 

### Existential values 
Designers reflect on their values to discern what companies they work at and what products, services, and experiences they design. They might consider their own political, religious, or moral views.

### Misdirected intent
Designers prioritize other goals and needs, most often business goals, above the users’ needs. An example of this is when Uber charges more during peak hours due to high demand rather than staffing more drivers during those hours.

### Benevolent intent
Designers put the user and their needs at the forefront of all design decisions while taking a pragmatic approach to product development and business needs. For example, a company displays benevolent intent when allowing users to test a product to ensure it fits their needs before purchasing it.

## A Designer’s Code of Ethics, by Mike Monteiro
Mike Monteiro, co-founder and design director of [Mule Design](https://muledesign.com/), an interactive design studio, outlined [A Designer’s Code of Ethics](https://deardesignstudent.com/a-designers-code-of-ethics-f4a88aca9e95), often referenced as an ethical standard throughout the design field. Anyone who becomes a designer must accept responsibility for the impact on the people who use their designs.
-   A designer is first and foremost a human being.
-   A designer is responsible for the work they put into the world.
-   A designer values impact over form.
-   A designer owes the people who hire them not just their labor but their counsel.
-   A designer welcomes criticism.
-   A designer strives to know their audience.
-   A designer does not believe in edge cases.
-   A designer is part of a professional community.
-   A designer welcomes a diverse and competitive field.
-   A designer takes time for self-reflection.
