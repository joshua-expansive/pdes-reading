# How Imagery Drives User Experience 
90 percent of all information our brain perceives is visual. In using imagery in design, you differentiate your product and communicate complex messages outside the language context. It's a lower effort or cognitive load to process images vs. a long paragraph of text. Images can make or break a user experience, so it's important to understand a few guiding principles for using them.
## Use context-relevant images
Using images that don't connect with the theme or content of your page will confuse. Understand your product goals and using compelling, intentional imagery to help convey the right message.

## Limit the number of images
Users ignore when a page is too busy or visually cluttered with decorative images that don't serve a particular purpose. Use thoughtful and eye-catching imagery to capture the user's attention.

## Use high-quality images
A polished design has no room for blurry, pixelated, and distorted images. Ensure that you select images suited for the appropriate device size and resolution, and NEVER stretch an image while compromising its proportions.

## Consider purpose over making it pretty
When in doubt, chose clarity over decoration. Reserve images for only when they serve a purpose. Images without reason can also add to the cognitive load and make it hard for users to process the information or content, and sometimes miss essential call-to-actions.
