# Inheriting UX Designs

Working in product teams, you're often handing off a project to the next person to continue, progress or analyze. This is especially true of researchers and UX designers passing on projects to the specialist UI designer that will add the final polish, raise the fidelity, or pass off to developers.

There are several techniques to assess a given set of UX deliverables before continuing work on them. It is important to understand context, purpose and evaluate it.

## Start with the high-level questions
Seek answers to the following questions when handed UX deliverables before beginning work on it:
- What is the purpose the product? What is the core value this product provides to the user?
- What does it do? How does the product alleviate user problems and concerns?
- Why was it created? What is the business incentive and stakeholder goals for this product?
- What needs further validation? What part of the product hasn't been tested or proven valuable? What is an assumption?

## Test it, analyze it 
Consider conducting a usability walkthrough if the product is at the prototype stage or currently live. If not, a wireflow could also be used to assess the following:
- navigation
- hierarchy
- clarity and understanding
- content audit

## Converting to high-fidelity
When you are working with designed wires/live product, assess the user interface before deciding to update, adjust, or redo the design.
- Consider the appropriateness of the design in relation to the brand attributes and product goal
- Consider which UI patterns are used, and which of those are made into reusable components
- Check for consistencies
