# Material Design and Apple HIG
## The differences between Google's Material and Apple's HIG
Google and Apple have very different schools of thought when it comes to the interactions with their devices and applications.
### Depth of Field
Google believes that humans should interact with their components as if they were sheets of paper stacked on top of each other. The depth is tactile and makes the user feel that they are holding each screen in the palm of their hand. 
> The fundamentals of light, surface, and movement are key to conveying how objects move, interact, and exist in space and in relation to each other. Realistic lighting shows seams, divides space, and indicates moving parts.

Apple, on the other hand, embraces infinite depth in their applications and uses components such as their alert buttons and text messages with blurred background to create the feeling that the items are floating and exist in their own space. 
> Depth. Visual layers and realistic motion impart vitality and heighten people’s delight and understanding.

### Animation
Where Google tends to mimic human behavior in animation where Apple tends to lean on the inorganic, simple interactions - serving you to get from point A to B.
### Navigation
Apple has streamlined their navigation with set rules. They use a “tab bar” at the bottom of the screen with an app’s 5 main, sometimes a hamburger icon for less important navigational items. The limit forces designers to think carefully about their app’s features. 

Google uses the hamburger nav as their primary navigation acting as a drawer of options, including profile, etc. This allows for a lot more flexibility and customization in their navigation.
## Android
Android design should follow material design guidelines.
-   [Android Design Guidelines](https://developer.android.com/design/), [Material Design specifics for Android](https://material.io/guidelines/platforms/android.html)
-   [App Icon Guidelines & Sizes](https://material.io/guidelines/style/icons.html#icons-product-icons)
-   [Custom Icons Guidlines](https://material.io/guidelines/style/icons.html#icons-system-icons)

-   [Design patterns and templates](https://material.io/guidelines/resources/sticker-sheets-icons.html#sticker-sheets-icons-components) for Sketch, Photoshop, Adobe XD, Illustrator, and After Effects
## Apple
Apple follows the Human Interface Design Guidelines (HIG). The patterns and templates are downloadable for Sketch, Photoshop, Adobe XD, Illustrator, and After Effects.

Cognitive psychologists provided the foundations of many design guidelines through findings from their studies. Over the years and with changing technology and behavior, these guidelines change and evolve. Design guidelines fall into several groups, including:

1.  **Style** – e.g., brand logos, colors
2.  **Layout** – e.g., grid or list structure
3.  **User interface (UI) components** – e.g., menus, buttons
4.  **Text** – e.g., font, tone, labels/fields
5.  [**Accessibility**](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/accessibility) – e.g., Aria markup for disabled users
6.  [**Design Patterns**](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/ui-design-patterns) – e.g., forms

Those designing across a range of operating systems each have its design guidelines to follow.
