With the ever growing tech landscape, responsive web design (RWD) becomes a more necessary best practice than ever. Responsive design refers to when a web page is designed to respond to changing environments, such as varying devices, screen sizes, and resolutions, etc. This means that all content within a web page will shift dynamically in order to best fit the available space. On desktop, when resizing a browser window, elements will adjust to accommodate the size of the browser window. On smartphones, this process occurs automatically with the website assessing the available space of the device and elements readjusting accordingly.

Despite the significant impact RWD can have on the user experience of a web page, it’s actually extremely common to encounter designs that are non-responsive. We’ve all encountered websites that are completely unnavigable on a mobile device. They often involve endless horizontal scrolling in order to just read the content on the page or there’s even content that’s disappears completely. These types of websites are often referred to as a “non-responsive” or “fixed” designs, meaning that they maintain the same structure no matter the available space. This type of inconvenience can not only lead to frustration for users but can ultimately result in high numbers of user dropoff.
