# Convergence Methods
Once you’ve understood the meaningful relations between the data, you still need to take those insights and decide what to do next. Convergence methods add practical constraints and should facilitate another round of conversations among participants. They can help you define the “so what?” after a synthesis session. 

## How does the group decide how to plot the information?
When you use convergence methods, the group should establish decision-making criteria. This is how you get to decisions without weakening the idea with compromises. Luckily, you should have lots of information to pull in as criteria: research insights, trends, client strategy, constraints around technical abilities, project goals, and timeline. The key is to make these criteria explicit to the group, so everyone is on the same page and understands the rules to make decisions.

This model helps evaluate concepts more so than surfacing insights. Participants making this model should have the expertise to determine the appropriate place for ideas; otherwise, it turns into ‘wishful thinking.’

An [optional addition](https://uxpamagazine.org/the-fourth-lens-making-design-thinking-work-for-digital-health/) to this popular activity is to add a fourth lens that turns it into an ‘evidence-based’ model. 

### Dot Voting
[Dot voting](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Dot-voting) is one of the fastest ways to achieve consensus but be aware of the group’s interpersonal dynamics. Just because a process is democratic doesn’t mean the group will make the best decision. The method may suffer the effects of groupthink, where to avoid conflict, people tend to agree with the majority. If there is a hierarchy of roles in the room, people are less likely to contradict their manager or someone with higher authority. 

### Problem Statement
A problem statement identifies:
-   the core goal your design must address,
-   who it is solving the problem for, 
-   and what their need is from the research insights. 
    
> Customers making a purchase with the Apple credit card need to know how many points they can use because customers who use their points spend 20% more on average. 

> Museum patrons with a membership need a guided way to do deeper study on the artwork because they want to feel impacted by the art beyond just their visit. 

In the first example, the problem statement reflects the business's point of view. The second example is about what motivates the museum patrons. **What your user needs and what the business needs are often very different things.** For example, a citizen registering to vote is motivated by making sure their voice is heard. But the business is motivated by checking for eligibility. 

When writing a problem statement, keep the scope of your synthesis results in mind. A problem statement that is too broad will not have enough constraints for productive ideation. A problem statement that is too narrow will be overly prescriptive and dampen creative exploration during the solution phase. There should be many different ways you might potentially solve the problem statement.

### SWOT Analysis
A SWOT Analysis can quickly help a team decide on a course of action and overcome challenges. It considers the internal and external factors that exert influence over the project. This method has three parts. First, plot your data according to Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats.

**Strengths** are internal things about the project that are within your ability to change. They might include unique resources or how you stand out from competitors. 

**Weaknesses** are internal variables acting as blockers or constraints that limit your ability to meet your goals. 

**Opportunities** are external to your team that you might take advantage of, like social trends, shifting attitudes, or new lifestyle demographics. 

**Threats** are anything external that might undermine the project. This could include things like negative customer feedback, a competitors new feature, or new legislation on accessibility that your product does not adhere to. 

Once you finish plotting the data, each team member should vote for three items they think will have the most significant impact. Then rank the items from most to least important. Finish the analysis by developing a strategic plan to decide how best to move forward on the top things you select. For items in the Strengths quadrant, you might ask: How will we use these to take advantage of the Opportunities? For items in Weaknesses, ask: How can we overcome these to take advantage of the Opportunities?
