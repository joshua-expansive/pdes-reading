# Launching a Website
Most website builders and content management system services will provide a one-stop-shop solution so you can get your website up and running quickly and with ease. That’s a good reason why it’s become so popular. However, if you find you want to understand better the basics of launching a website or want to attempt it yourself, you’ll want a baseline understanding of the three major pieces: Domain Names, Hosting, and Website Files.

## Domain Names
This is the URL you type in to reach a specific website and can be a combination of letters and numbers. What comes before the period in the domain name is up to you. What comes after the period is called the domain name extension. Putting the two together is the full domain name, and as long as it’s not already owned by someone else, it can be your portfolio URL. You need to secure the rights to a domain name in order to use it for your portfolio.

Generally, there is a cost that varies by domain extension type: .casino is more expensive than say .net, and .fr, for example, requires residency in France. If you find a domain name and extension that you like, you can often purchase it with your hosting and sometimes even as the website builder package. Whatever you select, find something that is part of your personal brand and also easily searchable on the web. 

The design program has a special partnership with [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com/designation) to offer designers a .design domain for a discounted price. (You must use this link to get the promotion.) If you want to create a new .design domain or transfer an existing site to a new .design domain, now’s a good time. This offer doesn’t apply to existing .design domains, in case  you already have one. In a year, you’ll be contacted by Porkbun and, if you choose to renew your domain, will pay for the following year at full price at that time.

## Hosting
Hosting or web hosting providers refers to a company that provides the technologies and services that allow a website or web service to be globally accessible and viewable from the internet. Files are stored or hosted on computers called servers that are called upon when someone types in a particular URL or domain name and then displayed in a browser. 

There are plenty of recommended hosting services out there at various prices. Though most do, if your website builder or CMS doesn’t provide hosting or it’s expensive, you can look for cheaper alternatives. Most hosting services hit the mark, but you do want to look for ones that have high uptime, the amount of time that a server has been reliable and stayed up and running. You may find many CMS providers do not allow you to divorce their website builder from the hosting. If you can, [you have plenty of options to select from.](https://www.pcmag.com/roundup/316108/the-best-web-hosting-services)

## Website Files
Website files hold the code that is executed in a browser and sit or are hosted on servers that are served up to the viewer by means of the internet when a viewer types in the domain name or URL.

These are where the code and programming of your website live. These files are executable code placed on your hosting servers and tell browsers precisely what to show and how. It is the foundation of your website, and most website builders generate these files for you instead of requiring you to write the code yourself.
