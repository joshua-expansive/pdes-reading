# Annotating UI Designs
## Best practices for annotation
### 1.  Identify your end-users
You won’t always be able to curate your annotations to every single role.
Consider the following:
-   Who is my primary target audience?
-   What key roles currently exist on the team or will need to exist in the future to ensure successful execution?
#### Possible end users may include:
-   Clients/Product Owners
-   Front End Developers
-   Back End Engineers
-   UX Designers
-   UI Designers
-   IXD Designers
-   Business Analysts
-   Copywriters
-   Content Strategists
### 2.  Communicate the what
-   Functional requirements
-   Interaction models
-   Architecture and hierarchy
-   Interactions and states
-   Functionality
-   Content
-   Language
-   Design patterns and visual details
-   Conditional functionality and states (ex. If \_\_\_\_\_\_ occurs, then \_\_\_\_\_\_ happens.)
### 3.  Communicate the why
-   Intent and reasoning
-   Goals and principles
-   Best practices
-   Data and user feedback
-   Research insights
-   Business constraints
-   Technical constraints
-   Project constraints
### 4.  Document what’s not visible
A system should allow for multiple outcomes, and is made out of many components, modules, flows, screens, and states, all of which can appear in various ways in various contexts.
Consider the following:
-   What were we not able to convey and are not represented in our wireframes or prototype?
-   What is visible but could benefit from additional explanation and context?
-   What are the non-ideal or infrequent paths that users might find themselves taking? 
-   Invalid login, no internet connection, new user onboarding, etc.

### 5.  Use consistent terminology
Make sure your team is aligned on language and terminology. If you refer to the “top nav” somewhere and refer to the same component as “home nav” somewhere else in your annotations, this could lead to confusion.

## Documenting 'States'
Documenting a system means documenting system states. A system will allow for multiple outcomes and is built from components, modules pages, and screens that can appear in multiple ways in various contexts. Someone has to decide for all of these. By being comprehensive, we anticipate these decisions and define them now.

### Five “classic” UI states
Ideal, Empty, Error, Partial, Loading
