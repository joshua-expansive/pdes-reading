# Intro to Type Terminology

There’s a lot of jargon around typography, which originates back to the early days of typesetting. For now, we’ll cover some of the basic terminologies that you’ll encounter as a designer:


### Typeface: 
The terms typeface and font are often used interchangeably, but they refer to two different things. While font describes the graphical representation of a collection of letters and characters, typeface refers to a family of related fonts; it represents the creative body of work itself. In the same way that a music album is a collection of songs, a typeface is a collection of fonts. It’s also worth noting that the term typeface is more commonly associated with traditional print. In contrast, the term font is most widely associated with the digital world, especially since more digital fonts stand independent without a family of variants that would make it a typeface. 

### Font: 
The term font describes the physical embodiment of letters and characters, such as a digital font file or a collection of metal types. Each font file consists of data that make up the font, such as the letter shapes, spacing, and other styling features. So while Helvetica is an example of a typeface, Helvetica Bold is an example of a font within that typeface.

### Font weight:
The weight of a font refers to the thickness of a font. A typeface can consist of many fonts with varying weights, including light, regular, medium, semibold, bold, extra bold, and ultra black.

### Font style 
The style of a font refers to regular, italic, or oblique style of the letters.

### Font size:
Font size is the height (known as the x-height) and the width (known as the set width) of a letter or character. The most common measurement is the point system, which dates back to early printing days and is still widely used today. Digitally, font sizes are most commonly measured with pixels or in ems.

### Tracking
Tracking is often called letter spacing or character spacing, and refers to the horizontal spacing distributed evenly between each letter in a piece of text.

### Kerning:
Kerning horizontal space between a designated pair of letters. Unlike tracking, spacing is not always distributed evenly. This is typically used to modify awkward overlaps that may occur when two letters are used consecutively.  When ignored, kerning could really alter the message.

### Leading:
Leading is line height or line spacing, and refers to the vertical space between lines of text. **Generally, the leading should be 1.25 to 1.5 times greater than the font size.**

**Line lengths** refers to the width of a text block. For English body text, the ideal line length is between 40 to 60 characters.

**Alignment** refers to how text is aligned within a space. There are four types of text alignment options: left-aligned, right-aligned, centered, and justified.

**White space**, also known as negative space, refers to the area around the content. For text,  white space takes margins, padding, and any other area without any text or graphics.
