# Job and Outcome Statements
## Job statements
Job statements are clear (no compound concepts) and do not contain preferences, observations, or techniques. “Quickly find the cheapest vacation package using my phone” is incorrect. “Quickly” and “cheapest” are needs, which are dealt with separately. “Using my phone” is a specific technology. The correct job statement would be “Go on vacation.”

Since jobs don’t rely on a particular solution or technology a useful rubric for job statements is to ask: Would someone have been doing this 50 or 100 years ago? 

To write a job statement, follow this simple pattern.
> verb + object + clarifier
- Stay informed about my boarded pet.
- Establish a retirement portfolio.
- Digitize highlighted passages from physical books. 
## Outcome statements and circumstances
**Outcome statements** are related to getting the main job accomplished and provide a way to establish success criteria. From the user’s point of view, a need related to the main job “Go on vacation,” might be “Minimize the time it takes to share memories with my family and friends.” 

To write an outcome statement, follow this pattern. 
> direction of change + unit of measurement + object + clarifier

Here is how the example outcome statement breaks down with the pattern. 
> direction of change (minimize) + unit of measurement (time) + object (share memories) + clarifier (with friends and family). 

More examples:
-   Increase the chance that everyone participates in the collaboration.
-   Reduce the chance that someone gets lost.
-   Maximize my ability to integrate outcomes into existing documents.

**Circumstances** take into account the relevant contextual (when/where) that add meaning to the job. It makes it more precise. For the job “Go on vacation,” a circumstance to consider could be “when I only have three days” or “when I’m with my family.”
