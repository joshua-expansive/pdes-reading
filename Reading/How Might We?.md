# Asking 'How Might We?'
## Turning challenges into opportunities
Once you define themes and insights, you draft problem statement(s) or challenges for the user. One way to take these challenges and make them design opportunities, you can frame them into *How Might We* questions or statements. This format gives you various ways to answer the challenge while employing the framework for innovative thinking. 

The actual value of running *How Might We* workshops as you enter the ideation phase is getting different solutions to the same problem/challenge. It simply re-frames problems into opportunities.

Designers don’t have answers to everything, but this method allows you to explore a range of concepts instead of jumping straight into the solutions.

It also ensures many ideas that could lead to a solution, permitting everyone to contribute without judgment within a team.

## Finding the balance of “just right.”
It’s essential to frame your problem from the point of view of your users without restricting the creativity and ensuring that it is specific enough to achieve.

[DesignKit](https://www.designkit.org/methods/how-might-we) offers this example of a *How Might We* question. 

**Too broad:** How might we redesign public toilets in India?

**Too narrow:** How might we create a doorknob for Indian public toilets that is clean, safe, and invites users in?

**Just right:** How might we create a real sense of safety in public toilets?

The final question allows for a variety of solutions and emphasizes a positive change to the status quo.

## Writing 'How might we' questions
The goal is to find design opportunities, so if your insights suggest several *How Might We* questions, that’s great. 

An easy place to start is by taking insight statements for user needs and goals and rephrasing them as questions by adding “How might we” at the beginning.
	
Some examples of _How might we_ questions:	
- **How might we** ensure more people pay their taxes before the deadline?
- **How might we** make customers feel that their information is safe and secure when creating an account?
- **How might we** ensure more people pay their taxes before the deadline?
- **How might we** help employees stay productive and healthy when working from home?
- **How might we** make customers feel that their information is safe and secure when creating an account?
- **How might we** help employees stay productive and healthy when working from home?

If your first draft of questions don’t allow for a variety of solutions, broaden them. Your *How Might We* should generate many possible solutions and become an important start to your ideation process.

Make sure your questions are not so broad that it becomes difficult to brainstorm solutions solutions.
