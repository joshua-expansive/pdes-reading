# Information Design
Information design is the practice of presenting information in a way that reduces uncertainty and makes it accessible and easily understood by most users. People consume information constantly–including instructions, figures, data, and tables. Designers must work with a set of defined objectives to ensure the right message is transmitted clearly and accurately. Complex data must be organized and simplified in a way that enhances comprehension.

###### Charles Minard's map of Napoleon's disastrous Russian campaign of 1812. The graphic is notable for its representation in two dimensions of six types of data: the number of Napoleon's troops; distance; temperature; the latitude and longitude; direction of travel; and location relative to specific dates.

In many ways, information design overlaps with information architecture, in that you are designing information spaces for optimal use and understanding. In the diagram below, based on ideas by Jessie James Garrett in The Elements of User Experience, you see that information design begins with a deep understanding of the data and content, which determines the functionality, that in turn, makes up the bulk of the presentation layer.

###### 

Information visualization, or **data visualization**, it the process by which data is represented visually so that the recipient builds an accurate representation of it in their mind. In it's raw form, data is mostly worthless; not adequate for finding meaning or communicating. To have value, it must be organized, transformed, and presented in a way that gives it meaning.

###### Visualization by information designer, [Michela Lazzaroni.](https://www.behance.net/michelaz) The visualization shows the winners’ performances in the “Giro d’Italia” (Tour of Italy) from 1909 ti 2016.

**Unstructured data** has no model and is typically qualitative and categorical in nature. It's not easily searchable and includes a range of formats like text, audio, social media posts, email, imagery, and sensor data. In contrast, **structured data** is highly organized and searchable. Structured data is typically stored in a **relational database** where it can be sorted, ordered, filtered, combined, grouped, categorized, measured, and counted. You are likely familiar with many tools that use a relational database. Airtable, Notion, and Asana are software tools that let users manipulate data stored in a relational database. Records (objects) are stored in rows, while attributes are stored in columns. 

Data visualization is also used to present information in a graphical format. Once the problem and data to be represented is defined, product designers can select the right dimensions, structures, and interactions necessary for the visualization.
