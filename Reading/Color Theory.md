# Color Theory 
Color theory is the study of how we perceive color and the practice of mixing, matching, and contrasting colors to evoke specific moods. Color is often the first design element that people respond to. It can elicit distinct emotions and expectations from an audience before engaging fully with the content, design, brand, or product.

Despite being a topic that’s often connected to more creative fields, people have studied the [science of color](https://library.si.edu/exhibition/color-in-a-new-light/science) throughout history, with a steadfast fascination with the relationship between light and color.

> Light comes to Earth from the sun in waves. Some of the waves are longer. Some of the waves are shorter. We see the waves as the colors of the rainbow. Each color has a different wavelength.

Color originates from light, and so without light, there would be no colors. Even though we often describe beams of light as white, it’s actually a combination of all the colors in the light spectrum. An excellent example of this is how white light reflects on the water like a rainbow, allowing us to see every color in the visual light spectrum. 

For colors or pigments seen on physical surfaces, like painted signage or printed paper, it’s the opposite. The absence of color results in white, and the combination of all colors produces black. You may have experienced this when mixing paint colors.

## The Color Circle
In his book *Optiks*, Isaac Newton illustrated the first color circle, based on the primary colors red, yellow, and blue. While there have been countless variations of that color wheel, its core purpose has stayed the same, to be a tool to visualize better and understand the relationships of colors.

###### [Moses Harris, *The Natural System of Colours*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_wheel)

The color wheel organizes colors into three categories.
-   **Primary colors**, also known as source colors, cannot be made with mixtures of other colors. Red, yellow, and blue are the primary colors.
-   **Secondary colors** are made by mixing the primary colors. For example, mixing red (a primary color) and yellow (a primary color) gives us orange, a secondary color.
-   **Tertiary colors** combine primary and secondary colors. Mixing red (a primary color) and orange (a secondary color) yields red-orange, a tertiary color.

The color wheel comprises three primary colors, three secondary colors, and six tertiary colors. It is divided in half by warm colors (reds, oranges, yellows) and cool colors (blues, greens, purples). Warm colors tend to be interpreted as attention-grabbing, energetic, and vibrant, while cool colors tend to be more passive, calming, and safe.

As you dig further into color practices, you’ll find the following color mixing terms helpful in color understanding and discussions.
-   Hue: Colors found on the color wheel or the visible light spectrum.
-   Tint: A hue with white added.
-   Tone: A hue with grey (or black and white) added.
-   Shade: A hue with black added.
-   Saturation: The intensity of the color.
-   Luminance: The amount of light or brightness.
