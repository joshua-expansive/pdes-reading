# Research for Visual Design


  As a visual designer, you’ll often find yourself designing from one of two positions: One, creating designs for a new brand without any existing design systems or guidelines, or creating designs for an existing brand with established design systems and guidelines. No matter your position, fostering a solid research practice will allow you to:

-   Gain a greater understanding of the industry and domain
    
-   Gain a greater understanding and empathy for the target audience
    
-   Identify best practices and potential opportunities in the existing marketplace

### Exploratory Research

The goal of exploratory research is to gather detailed insight to narrow down your design direction and build a relationship with your stakeholder. Create a list of questions to understand the domain, industry, and company better. At a minimum, your questions should address: 

-   The goals of the project
    
-   Key characteristics or” personality” of the company in its current state
    
-   The future of the company (including projects, products, and services)
    
-   The scope of the project and its relation to other current or future projects
    
-   Any metrics to consider for the project
    

As answers to your questions arise, remind them that visual design is not merely an aesthetic or point of attraction – interfaces are highly valuable communication tools that affect the general public on both a visceral level and a subconscious cognitive level.

### User Research

To understand your target audience, you’ll need to find out more about their goals, wants needs, frustrations, and preferences. Depending on how much time, money, and resources you have at your disposal, you can gather user insights in various ways. We’d recommend you use a combination of some of the following: 

-   Surveys to assess people’s views on brands. Surveys are mostly used to collect quantitative data, and they are very low-risk/high-reward when completed correctly.  Participants typically fill them out online and are rewarded with a small compensation (like a gift card).
    
-   Focus groups to assess people’s views on brands. If your audience is relatively large, you may find value in focus groups. In these cases, you bring in different types of people who can give you qualitative feedback about multiple people’s perspectives, opinions, and emotional responses.
    
-   Brand awareness interviews to assess how much people know about a brand. Typically done during a focus group, brand awareness interview questions gauge what people recognize about a brand. For example, you can ask if people are familiar with a brand and then ask about their perception of that brand: What does that company mean to them? How familiar are they with their goods and services? How do they perceive the value of that company over a competitor? Are there any associations they make with the brand? 
    
-   Social studies to assess what people think about a brand. Social intelligence research involves a less structured approach to interviewing and can allow for quantitative and qualitative data collection. Instead of adhering to a specific task sheet or questionnaire, you give participants limited directions and let them lead the conversation into potentially unexpected territory.
    
-   Ethnographic research to build more empathy. This research is done by conducting one-on-one conversations with consumers in their everyday surroundings while also drawing inferences about them based on observations you make in those surroundings. Ethnographic research allows designers to see the world through the consumer’s perspective and to get a feel for how a design operates in their lives. It’s more effective than any other qualitative research method at giving designers insights that will help them develop designs that will resonate with and please consumers from an emotional and functional standpoint.
    
-   User testing to assess how people respond and interact with a design: This might focus on both desirability (how people react to a design) and usability (how people interact with a design). This can be used to collect qualitative data through moderated user interviews and testing sessions or to collect quantitative data through methods such as [quantitative eye tracking](http://uxmag.com/articles/quantitative-research-and-eye-tracking), [A/B testing](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/A/B_testing), or [unmoderated remote user testing](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/remote-usability-tests/). These methods are quick, less expensive, and cast a wide net of users.

### Competitive Analysis

Look to the existing marketplace to better understand what competitors are currently doing, identify emerging trends, and find your own brand’s advantage. Learn from what other competitors have done and how they have succeeded or failed to create designs that better engage with your intended audience and foster a consumer-brand relationship based on trust. 

Conducting a competitive analysis is a great way to assess and record successes (to mirror) and failures (to avoid) of other competitors. When conducting a competitive analysis, taking into account direct and indirect competitors will allow you to gain more inspiration and takeaways. For example, suppose you’re designing a ridesharing app. In that case, direct competitors might include Uber and Lyft. For indirect competitors, you might look at food delivery apps since they share similarities such as: relying on a driver, having a dropoff point, high demand of service, peak hours, etc. Challenge yourself to expand beyond just what you see and answer the “why and how” by considering these areas:

-   **Voice and tone:** How would you describe the overall brand’s voice and tone? What’s contributing the most to this perception?
    
-   **Market position:** How does this brand compare to others in the marketplace? How is it differentiated?
    
-   **Color palette:** What colors are being used, and how are they impacting the design’s brand, usability, or desirability?
    
-   **Typography:** What typefaces are being used? How is the size and placement of text/copy adding or detracting to user goals?
    
-   **Imagery:** What imagery is being used, and what emotions do they evoke?
    

Other key areas to analyze are:

-   **Logos:** Logos act as the face of the brand and are primary touchpoints for consumers. Often, the logo and the brand become so intertwined that the logo is mistaken for the brand itself. Observe how brands leverage their logos.
    
-   **Design Systems:** Design systems serve as a designer’s insurance policy by establishing blueprints and context of how their designs work. Some of your competitors may even share their design systems -- if so, take advantage of this incredibly detailed breakdown of their design systems, elements, and guidelines.

### Research Synthesis

While research doesn’t necessarily determine good design, it is an essential first step in ensuring a design’s success. Just as valuable as conducting research is the process of synthesizing that research. Designers should lean on [data sorting strategies](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/prioritization-matrices/), such as affinity mapping, to look for insight patterns. The synthesis also involves producing deliverables and artifacts that can be used as tools for alignment and communication.
