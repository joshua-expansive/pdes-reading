# Bias and Self-Awareness in Research

It’s impossible to rid ourselves and our work of all bias completely. But we can be honest and commit to continuous self-examination. Designer bias can unintentionally derail a project, and at worst, be downright harmful to others. In [The 7 Deadly Sins of User Research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS81W1xHuVw), psychologist and user experience strategist David Travis lecture on three types of bias in user research.
## These types of bias are common in research
- **Sampling bias** happens when you don’t include essential parts of your market that you should be studying. A straightforward example would be reviewing the habits of people who own pets and only including people who adopt. Any survey results would not represent the full range of pet owners’ behaviors.

- **Method bias** is when you collect data only using one kind of method rather than triangulating several methods.
- **Response bias** happens when you ask participants poorly posed questions that results in unconsciously curated responses. This type of bias is prevalent during user interviews and usability studies.
- **Cherry-picking** research results often happen during analysis and synthesis. If an individual or team accidentally (or worse explicitly) ignores data that contradicts their assumptions, they are no longer conducting good research. Your stakeholders are likely to be biased towards evidence supporting a particular solution or design direction preference. Conversely, they will be biased _against_ any evidence that invalidates that solution. 
## Ways to combat bias
Bias can be introduced at any stage of the design process, starting at the initial business requirements, to initial research, usability testing, all the way to shipping the final product. The fact that we are unaware of when it is happening makes it impossible to eliminate.
### Personal bias
Begin by building awareness of your own biases. If you don’t spot them, you cannot be honest with yourself or not look hard enough. Eventually, you will learn to correct for bias at the team, project, and even organization level.

###### [Cognitive bias cheat sheet](https://medium.com/better-humans/cognitive-bias-cheat-sheet-55a472476b18)

Like many things in design, an excellent place to start is with questions. Here are a few to ask yourself throughout a project.
- Am I afraid of being wrong?
- Am I accountable to someone else for the quality of my research?
- Are my research goals clear enough?
- Who is involved in the analysis of the research?
- When was the last time I reflected on my performance during an interview or usability session?
- Am I worried about confrontation?
- Do I feel pressured to move unnecessarily fast?
 
As the author of, [Why Are We Yelling? — The Art of Productive Disagreement](https://www.amazon.com/Why-Are-Yelling-Productive-Disagreement-ebook/dp/B07P1MH869/ref=tmm\_kin\_swatch\_0?\_encoding=UTF8&qid=1555959964&sr=8-1) mentions, bias is not always a negative thing. Bias is a useful trait in some scenarios we encounter with information overload or acting fast without understanding the full context.
> Cognitive biases are just tools, useful in the right contexts, harmful in others. They’re the only tools we’ve got, and they’re even pretty good at what they’re meant to do. We might as well get familiar with them and even appreciate that we at least have some ability to process the universe with our mysterious brains.
### In user interviews
There is more discussion about interview bias in the section about User Interviews. For now, you should know that developing a neutral interview style helps with a host of human behavioral traits that will bias your work.

**Social desirability bias** means that you are in a position of power (actual or perceived—it doesn’t matter). In [Just Enough Research](https://abookapart.com/products/just-enough-research), author and researcher Erika Hall writes:

> Everyone wants to look their best. People want to be liked. It can be hard to admit to an interviewer that you don’t floss or pay off your credit card bill every month, so participants will sometimes give the answers that cast the best light. Emphasize the need for honesty and promise of confidentiality. Also, be mindful of asking specific questions too soon or at the wrong time. Often, asking about a general topic (such as household routines) will naturally lead into more sensitive topics without triggering a defensive response.
  
Just by studying humans, you are inadvertently changing their behavior. Think about the last time your manager or an executive watched what you were doing. Did it change your speech? Your posture? Your actions? You may have demonstrated the **Hawthorne effect**: individuals react by modifying their behavior when they know they are being observed.
