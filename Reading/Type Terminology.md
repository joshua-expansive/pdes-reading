# Fundamentals of Typography

## General Terminology

There’s a lot of jargon around typography, which originates back to the early days of typesetting. For now, we’ll cover some of the basic terminologies that you’ll encounter as a designer:

**Typeface:** The terms typeface and font are often used interchangeably, but they refer to two different things. While font describes the graphical representation of a collection of letters and characters, typeface refers to a family of related fonts; it represents the creative body of work itself. In the same way that a music album is a collection of songs, a typeface is a collection of fonts. It’s also worth noting that the term typeface is more commonly associated with traditional print. In contrast, the term font is most widely associated with the digital world, especially since more digital fonts stand independent without a family of variants that would make it a typeface. 

**Font:** The term font describes the physical embodiment of letters and characters, such as a digital font file or a collection of metal types. Each font file consists of data that make up the font, such as the letter shapes, spacing, and other styling features. So while Helvetica is an example of a typeface, Helvetica Bold is an example of a font within that typeface.

**Font weight** refers to the thickness of a font. A typeface can consist of many fonts with varying weights, including light, regular, medium, semibold, bold, extra bold, and ultra black.

**Font style** refers to regular, italic, or oblique style of the letters

**Font size** refers to the height (known as the x-height) and the width (known as the set width) of a letter or character. The most common measurement is the point system, which dates back to early printing days and is still widely used today. Digitally, font sizes are most commonly measured with pixels or in ems.

**Tracking**, also known as letter spacing or character spacing, refers to the horizontal spacing distributed evenly between each letter in a piece of text.

**Kerning** refers to the horizontal space between a designated pair of letters. Unlike tracking, spacing is not always distributed evenly. This is typically used to modify awkward overlaps that may occur when two letters are used consecutively.

**Leading**, also known as line height or line spacing, refers to the vertical space between lines of text. Generally, the leading should be 1.25 to 1.5 times greater than the font size.

**Line lengths** refers to the width of a text block. For English body text, the ideal line length is between 40 to 60 characters. 

**Alignment** refers to how text is aligned within a space. There are four types of text alignment options: left-aligned, right-aligned, centered, and justified.

**White space**, also known as negative space, refers to the area around the content. For text,  white space takes margins, padding, and any other area without any text or graphics.

## Type Classifications 
Type classification is a system of organizing typefaces into categories, making it easier to identify and pair typefaces: serif, sans serif, script, monospaced and decorative.

**Serif typefaces** are defined by a serif (i.e., a small shape or projection) added to the beginning or end of a stroke. Because of serifs’ visual distinction, serif typefaces improve legibility and are often used for long lines of text, such as body text.
-   Common serif typefaces include: Times New Roman, Baskerville, and Garamond.
-   Common subclassifications of serif typefaces include Old-style, Slab serif, Transitional, and Didone or Neoclassical.

**Sans-serif typefaces** are defined by the lack of a serif. Sans-serif typefaces are commonly used for displaying digital text since it’s legible even on lower-resolution screens.
-   Common sans serif typefaces include: Helvetica, Arial, and Futura
-   Common subclassifications of sans serif typefaces include Grotesque, Neo-grotesque, Humanist, and Geometric.

**Script typefaces** are a distinct display typeface style based on the varied and fluid strokes modeled after handwriting. The particular technical style is generally not used for long-form body text but instead more often for headers.
-   Common script typefaces include: Coronet, Zapfino and Alex Brush
-   Common subclassifications of script typefaces include: Gothic, Calligraphic, Casual, and Elegant

**Monospaced** are utilitarian typefaces that are perfectly spaced fixed-pitch, fixed-width, each letter and character occupying the same amount of horizontal space. They are popular because of their readability of their letters, special characters, and words, especially in computer screens and programming.
-   Common monospaced typefaces include: Courier, Fixedsys, and Menlo.
-   Common subclassifications of monospaced typefaces include Humanist, Typewriter, Techno, and Industrial.

**Display** typefaces can be ornate, decorative, and attention-grabbing, aiming to entice the viewer but should be leveraged strategically and sparingly.
-   Common display typefaces include: Bauhaus, Forte and Cooper Black
-   Common subclassifications of display typefaces include Serif, San Serif, Ornate, Period, Wood, Script, Blackletter, and Decorative.
## Typography in design and communication
There are seven universal typographical design principles. Good typography helps you present your ideas to viewers and communicate effectively. These techniques and best practices are an excellent place to start.
1. **Typeface:** Use 2-3 typefaces at the most in a given design project to keep it uncluttered. You can pair serif fonts with sans-serif fonts, or use decorative fonts for an attention-grabbing headline, but never for main-body text where readibility is essential.
2. **Hierarchy:** Use variation in scale, typeface, weight and color, you can group like information and convey a path to reading the most important thing first.
3. **Contrast:** Vary size, typeface, weight, color, and style to organize your design and provide impact. 
4. **Consistency:** Decide on your typefaces, and their application and use it consistently. This will help give a polished look and make finding information/content easier.
5. **Alignment:** Ensure all elements of typography are in relation with each other. When stacking content, align body text with headline, which aligns with image or logo above that. Also, consider left alignment to be the safest, best choice, followed by right alignment to create interest. Avoid over-using center alignment as it looks messy, imbalanced, and amateur. 
6. **Whitespace:** Use whitespace to draw the viewer in and imply that whatever is within the large field of empty space must be important.
7. **Color:** Use contrast of color in typography to emphasize hierarchy and make text legible against the background color.
