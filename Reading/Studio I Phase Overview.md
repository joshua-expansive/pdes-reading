**Welcome to Studio I.** 
In this phase, you're going to learn about a popular framework in product design called Jobs to Be Done. There's a significant focus on Inclusive Design, digital ethics, and how design and technology impact consumer behavior. You'll round out your knowledge of evaluative research by conducting usability testing and learning how to evaluate the results. 

In **Project 5**, you're going to write and follow a research guide that will uncover the insights you need to create a new group travel feature for Kayak.com. 

In **Project 6**, you'll be working on the interface for an autonomous gardening system for restaurant chefs. 

Keep going! üëè
