**Welcome to Studio II.**
You've arrived! In this phase, you'll take on the role of project owner, which means you decide what to research, how you'll collect the data, and what to build. You'll need to use all the skills you've learned so far in your journey. Exciting, right?  

Since you will do all the research, design, and testing, **Project 8** is the only project in Studio II. It's heavily focused on information design and working with AI-informed content and recommendations. You'll learn quite a lot about running design projects and presenting your designs to stakeholders. We've given you lots of practice labs to build these skills, too. 

Give this project everything you've got! It's could be a smashing piece in your portfolio. ðŸ¤©
