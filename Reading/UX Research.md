###### [How to Set Up a User Research Framework (And Why Your Team Needs One)](https://dscout.com/people-nerds/how-to-set-up-a-user-research-framework-and-why-your-team-needs-one)

Research helps us understand and frame problems. Research helps us evaluate our ideas and solutions. It can lead to unexpected insights and innovation, uncover new markets and user segments, or reduce the risk of launching a new experimental feature in our software.

Sometimes you are focused on the problem, sometimes the solution, sometimes both. When you need to make decisions, there is always a research methodology to help you.

> User research helps us to understand how other people live their lives, so that we can respond more effectively to their needs with informed and inspired design solutions. User research also helps us to avoid our own biases, because we frequently have to create design solutions for people who aren’t like us. –[David Sherwin](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/09/5-step-process-conducting-user-research/)

## An Array of Methodologies
In the context of a project, each research type has many different methods you can use. Through this program, you will learn which one is appropriate to adopt and when. The research questions you have will determine the best approach, which is why it’s essential to be thoughtful and exact when writing them. 

### Primary vs. Secondary Research
Primary research refers to new research data, also known as “raw data”, that you collect yourself, rather than depending on existing data from previously conducted research. It involves gathering data directly from the source, typically through user interviews, user groups, contextual inquiry, surveys, etc.

Secondary research refers to leveraging existing data that has already been gathered, synthesized, and published by others. It relies on existing primary research published on the internet or printed articles, reports, books, trade journals, and other publications.

### Exploratory vs. Evaluative Research
Exploratory research, also known as generative research, aims to understand user needs and desires and ultimately influence problem framing, ideation, and concept development within a project. It’s often leveraged in the discovery phase when developing a brand new product or when an existing product is undergoing a design pivot or improvements. Because generative research focuses mainly on gathering user insights, there’s a lot of overlap with primary research methods such as user interviews, user groups, surveys, etc.

Evaluative research aims to assess or judge something that exists: this might be a specific problem, solution, concept, or something more tangible like a sketch, mockup, or prototype. The assessment aims to make sure solutions are rooted in the user’s needs and desires. 

There are two main types of evaluative studies:
-   **Formative evaluation** focuses on assessing and strengthening a design, such as a current state or concept, early on in the product development cycle. It’s often used to identify pain points and other problems that a team must address as development continues. An excellent example of a formative evaluation method is concept testing.
-   **Summative evaluation** focuses on assessing the outcome or effects of something rather than the process. It often occurs in the later stages of the product development cycle when a final or near-final design exists. An excellent example of a summative evaluation method is usability testing.
    
### Attitudinal vs. Behavioral Research
Attitudinal research focuses on gathering user insights based on what people say. It can result in skewed or biased data if participants lack self-awareness in certain areas, feel self-conscious, or are influenced by those around them, also known as “herd behavior”. Examples include user interviews, focus groups, and surveys.

Behavioral research focuses on gathering user insights by observing people’s actions and behaviors. It often allows for a greater understanding of user needs and desires that may occur at a subconscious cognitive level. Examples include contextual inquiry, ethnographic observation, usability testing, and field studies.

### Quantitative vs. Qualitative Research
**Quantitative research** is studying numbers. It leverages statistics and percentages, such as surveys, polls, and rating scales, and is particularly useful during decision-making and evaluation. When you need to know the scale of something–how big, how long, or how many–then you need quant-driven methods.  

**Qualitative research** is about studying qualities. It leverages research methods to understand a specific group’s shared experiences and behaviors, such as open-ended questions or contextual observation. It’s instrumental during the discovery phase of the design process or when working with small sample sizes that won’t yield large quantities of data.

## Quality vs. Speed
The demand for research and design continues to rise since it can [positively impact business](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-design/our-insights/the-business-value-of-design). We will continue to see new tools, methods, and strategies to meet the demand for scale and speed without compromising the research’s integrity. Frameworks like Google Sprints and Lean UX have become more common and can save a lot of time. The new field of ResearchOps finds ways to optimize and automate specific processes that can slow down research, such as participant recruiting.

###### [ResearchOps 101 (nngroup.com)](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/research-ops-101/)

There is a limit to letting speed dictate user research, however. The Director of Design and User Research at Microsoft, Joe Munko distinguishes disposable and timeless research:

> If you cut corners on quality, customer involvement, and adaptive planning, your research could become disposable…I know, that’s a bold statement. But here’s why: When time constraints force us to drop the rigor and process that incorporates customer feedback, the user research you conduct loses its validity and ultimately its value. —Joe Munko, [Skip User Research Unless You’re Doing It Right — Seriously](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/customer-insights-research/articles/skip-user-research-unless-youre-doing-it-right-seriously/)

Research is an iterative process. By baking it into the whole design process, you will grow a larger body of knowledge about your users and their needs. Meaningful research should compound value beyond a single feature or project. Therefore, how you plan, execute, synthesize, and communicate research is a significant factor in your design’s quality and longevity.
