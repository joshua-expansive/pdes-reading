# Moderating a Usability Test
Once designers have decided what they will be asking of their test participants using task scenarios, the type of data they want to collect, and have recruited users, they will need to decide which moderation technique will be most effective. [Usability.gov](http://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/running-usability-tests.html) outlines the most common strategies used when conducting usability testing:

**Concurrent Think Aloud (CTA)** asks the user to think aloud as they perform tasks. This should be a running stream of consciousness from the user to help give insight into their thoughts as they interact with the product.
-   The Good: Hear participants’ thoughts in real-time as they work through any problems
-   The Bad: Can skew usability metrics, especially time on task.
    
**Retrospective Think Aloud (RTA)** occurs after the session is complete. Designers will ask users to either retrace their steps through a task or watch a recording of their usage and explain their thoughts at that moment
-   The Good: No interference with usability metrics
-   The Bad: Increases test session length; It may be difficult for users to recall exact thoughts from up to an hour ago. This can result in insufficient or inaccurate data.
    
**Concurrent Probing (CP)** occurs when the designer asks follow-up questions as the user works through tasks. This may happen when the user says or does something to pique the designer’s interest.
-   The Good: Allows designers to be more thorough in understanding users’ thoughts as they work through a task
The Bad: There is potential for the designer to interfere with the user’s natural thought process or progression if they hadn’t stopped answering the designer’s questions. 
   
**Retrospective Probing (RP)** occurs in the post-test when the usability testing session is complete. This is an opportunity for the designer to ask follow-up questions they may have come up with as they perform actions or think aloud.
-   The Good: Does not interfere with usability metrics
-   The Bad: Since this is often reserved for the end of the test session, and users may have difficulty remembering some aspects or decisions they made during the test.

1. T or F: Restrospective probing occurs when the moderator asks the participant to recount their thoughts as they watch a recording of the usability test. (F, Retrospective Think Aloud)
2. T of F: Using Concurrent Think Aloud during a usability test will *significantly* increase the length of the overall test. (F, Restrospective Think Aloud will increase the total time of a usability test)
