# Rapid Desirability Testing
Desirability testing is used to measure a user’s emotional response and impressions of the aesthetics of a design. While it might seem strange to measure people’s emotional response and impressions, how someone responds to the visuals of a design can significantly influence how usable they perceive the product to be. This is often referred to as the [aesthetic-usability effect](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/aesthetic-usability-effect/).

Desirability testing can range from an existing, live product to a high-fidelity mockup. Like concept testing, it also doesn’t require designs to be interactive since it’s not task-based like usability testing. Although, it’s common to gather insights around user’s perception of interaction and functionality when desirability testing.
## Areas for testing
### First impressions
Gauge a user’s initial reaction to a design and compare how these reactions do or do not align with branding goals. (ex. What stood out to you? How would you describe that design?)
### Emotional response
Gauge a user’s emotional response to a design and determine what visual design elements contribute to that response. (ex. What does this design remind you of? What feelings would you associate with this design?)
### Brand perception
Gauge how the visual design impacts users’ impression of the more prominent brand and/or company. (ex. What other brands would you compare this design to? Why?)
## Desirability testing methods
- [5-Second Testing](https://usabilityhub.com/guides/five-second-testing): Also known as quick-exposure memory tests, this test helps to gauge users’ first impressions of a design and to understand what is memorable.
- [First-click Testing](https://usabilityhub.com/guides/first-click-testing): This test helps gauge how intuitive your designs are by observing how easy it is for a user to complete tasks.
- [Microsoft Desirability Toolkit](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/microsoft-desirability-toolkit/): Microsoft Product Reaction Card Method, was developed by Microsoft in the early 2000’s. It includes a series of 118 [product reaction cards](http://www.uxforthemasses.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Product-reaction-cards-printouts-full-list.pdf) and aims to gauge people’s attitudes towards a design using a controlled vocabulary list.
- [Preference Testing](https://usabilityhub.com/guides/preference-testing): This test helps to gauge the visual appeal of a design based on people’s preferences. We recommend avoiding asking people to choose their “favorite” design and instead leverage this testing method to ask more strategic questions like, “Which design do you find to be most trustworthy? What’s contributing to that?”.
- [Measuring Emotion](https://uxfactor.wordpress.com/2017/10/14/how-to-measure-emotion-in-design/): Asking questions and observing how people emotionally respond to a design.

# Quiz
1. Desirability testing is useful because:
	1. Our emotional responses determine our overall perception of a product. (correct)
	2. It is the fastest evaluative research method. 
	3. It only requires low-fidelity designs. 
	4. None of the above. 
2. T or F: Desirability testing works best when users make a clear choice about their favorite design. (F, it's more important to know why a design is, or is not working, and what elements in the design make them feel a certain way.)
