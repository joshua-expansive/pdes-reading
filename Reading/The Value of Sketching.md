While sketching is often leveraged early on in projects, when brainstorming and ideation are key, sketching is beneficial to many phases and areas of the design process.

Leverage sketching when needing to:
- Encourage open and creative ideation.
- Avoid distraction over quality and perfection.
- Try a different way of thinking and processing (i.e. [visual thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZikhQ5w5Ck)).
- To better understand how something might look or work in detail.
- Improve team alignment and understanding by providing greater visibility into how people are thinking and problem solving.
- Create more opportunities for collaboration, discussion, and feedback early on.
- Validate ideas and identify potential pain points before committing a lot of time and resources.
- Take notes for meetings and presentations (i.e. [Sketchnoting](https://medium.com/8px-magazine/create-memories-by-sketching-220398d3d027)).

## Common misconceptions
Sketching doesn’t require any technical or tool knowledge, making it a more approachable way of inviting stakeholders and non-designers to participate early on in the design process. You can quickly jump on a whiteboard to provide more context around an idea and get immediate feedback. Or, you can even facilitate a quick [sketch session](https://blog.prototypr.io/sketch-sessions-make-friends-and-design-better-3762e5842e7a) with stakeholders to better understand where they’re at and what they’re thinking.

### Misconception #1: I’m not an artist, so I can’t sketch.
Sketching is a form of communication and not a work of art, and, despite popular belief, it’s not the same as drawing or illustrating. If you can draw basic shapes, you can sketch. The goal is to be understood; it’s often the most simple line drawings that create the most significant understanding.

### Misconception #2: Sketches should be pixel perfect.
There’s a time and place to be pixel perfect, and sketches aren’t it. As a designer, you might feel pressured to produce beautiful deliverables, even with your sketches. Sketching should be quick and efficient, requiring minimal resources. It’s a way to focus on brainstorming ideas and solving problems without the distractions of making something look good. It’s a way to work through these ideas and issues collaboratively, in real-time. It’s by no means meant to be the end state and shouldn’t be approached like it is.

### Misconception #3: Sketching is unprofessional.
Sketching can also be undervalued and written off as an elementary activity due to the low fidelity aesthetic. This often comes down to expectation setting and communicating the value of sketching. Let’s say that you’re presenting to a group of stakeholders a new product feature. Provided you give context and foundational understanding the project is still in stages of ideation, a sketch can be as acceptable as a time-consumed finessed design. If you frame ideation meetings as a collaborative brainstorming session and create alignment around expectations and goals, you’ll be more likely to receive open-minded responses to the ‘crude’ nature of sketches.

### Misconception #4: Sketching is the same as paper wireframing.
It’s important to recognize that there are varying fidelities of sketches and paper wireframes, and so it can be easy to conflate the two. The most significant differentiating factors between the two are their goals and focuses. As we’ve learned, sketching is meant to be quick and dirty, and it focuses on capturing and conveying an idea, thought, or subject. It is not limited to interfaces; sketches can be used to brainstorm, capture meeting takeaways, or synthesize information. On the other hand, paper wireframes are more exact and are used to start thinking about how UI elements are laid out on a screen.

### Misconception #5: Sketching takes too much time.
When sketching ideas that will lead to a more polished end deliverable, one thing to consider is that, at some point, you’ll need to translate your sketches into the final deliverable. While this can feel like you’re adding an extra step, it’s saving a lot of time and headaches later on by validating ideas quickly and iteratively before committing to a single, potentially wrong, solution.  

### Misconception #6: Sketches don’t require iteration.
While a benefit of sketches is that they’re disposable, they can still be revisited and iterated on to be more effective. The fact that they’re disposable helps us feel less attached to specific ideas and designs, and so sketching is one of the simplest and most effective methods for [rapid ideation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVx9RLCnJH8). Sketching is also a skill, and as such, the more you do it, the better you’ll get at it.
