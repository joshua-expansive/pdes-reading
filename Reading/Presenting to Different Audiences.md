# Presenting to Different Audiences

Presenting is hard work. In fact, [some design professionals say it’s the toughest part of the job.](https://monteiro.medium.com/13-ways-designers-screw-up-client-presentations-51aaee11e28c) Taking a user-centered approach to your presentation is a design problem, like many others you have tackled up to this point. As you have learned, design is only as good as your ability to communicate it. It takes work to craft the story of your project and to tell that story in an engaging and professional manner that is appropriate for your audience. 

As a designer, you might be expected to present your work and decisions to a variety of stakeholders, including upper management, clients and internal team members. When you present your work to stakeholders, it’s important to keep your audience in mind to make sure that you’re conveying information in the most effective way. If you’re presenting to developers, be sure to target specific deliverables that communicate how the project needs to be built within the determined constraints. If you’re meeting with the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), highlight important data points and discuss the initial cost/eventual return on investment (ROI) of your designs. It sounds simple, but speaking to your audience can go a long way in growing your stakeholder-designer relationship and increasing their buy-in.

In any presentation, your primary objective is usually to communicate with your audience effectively. But what does that mean? Communication consists of sender, transmission, reception, receiver, and noise. Your job is to amplify the message signal and minimize the noise. Every element of a design presentation should be tuned to reduce interference and boost signal quality.

## Plan for Your Audience

To communicate as effectively as possible, designers should focus on the audience as they would a user when designing a product. To get the process of planning a presentation kicked off, a designer may consider some of the following questions.

- What does your audience care about? Tying your designs back to business goals shows executives that you understand what’s in it for them (and the business). By showing a strong correlation between a business objective (like increasing conversions) with customer expectations of your design, you’ll definitely earn their attention. Think about areas of agreement between you and the client and build the presentation from there. Find the overlap between that and your design ideas, that is the core of the presentation.

- What do they already know? How much background knowledge or context will they need to understand what you will present? Take a minute to set the stage, but keep it to about a minute. Call out who you worked with, what the goal of the project is, and what you’re going to show them right off the bat. Also be conscious of terminology. If you are presenting to non-designers, they may not be as familiar with specific concepts and terms.

- What is the framework for evaluating success? Remind the audience what success looks like. If your audience already agrees with the scorecard then your ideas will be received better. Why? Because you designed them with that evaluation in mind. The audience is viewing success through the same lens as you. Even if your ideas are critiqued or rejected, you will work collaboratively towards a solution because you all agree on how to evaluate success.

- What research findings best support your design decisions? If you’ve done ethnographic research, created personas, user stories, or journey maps, then you have a lot of material to pull from for storytelling. You can use direct quotes, images, animation, and video to keep your audience focused on the humans in your human-centered designs. Don’t talk about your users like a distant third-party. Keep your audience focused on how user input drove your design decisions. 

## Presentation Best Practices

- Break the problem into smaller pieces. Quick wins can be used to get buy in for the next chunk of the project.

- Keep your slides lean and varied. Don’t use a paragraph when a sentence will do. Don’t use a sentence if a short phrase or single word will work. The slides should reinforce what you say to the audience, not replace it. 

- Show your passion and personality. Don’t hide behind the laptop, or read a script. Engage the room and use body language to direct audience attention.

- Be Flexible. You should be ready to answer questions about your work. Take feedback graciously, but don’t be afraid to redirect if the feedback focuses on the wrong elements.

- Use your mistakes. If an actor makes a mistake on stage, the audience is usually unaware because they continue the scene. When you make a mistake, and you will, don't draw too much attention to it. 

- Rehearse, and rehearse again. Before presenting, it’s smart to do a dry run in front of a peer who will be honest and provide constructive feedback. Ask for very pointed feedback, including if your message is clear, you summarize well, and if you’re missing anything.
