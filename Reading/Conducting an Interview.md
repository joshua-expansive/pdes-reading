# Conducting an Interview
Interviews tend to follow a similar structure, with an introduction, a ramp-up into progressively more in-depth questions, and a wrap-up.

## The introduction
Make sure you explain the interview's purpose and essential details like how long the interview will take and what happens to the data you collect. Use your scripted intro from the interview guide to make sure you cover the necessary details.

Being interviewed can be a perplexing experience for some. Learning to build rapport at the top of the interview will set your participant at ease and help them engage with the questions. When [Indi Young](https://indiyoung.com/) conducts listening sessions, she uses empathic listening to develop rapport. 

> A listening session, especially as a participant, does elicit emotion. The participant is wondering about you. They might be thinking, "Who the heck is this person? Can I trust them? Are they going to try to get something from me that I didn't agree to give? Can I figure out what information they're after? Do they seem to like what I have to say, or are they judging me?" There is a lot of emotion there: wonder, distrust, fear, doubt, worry. If you are aware of the particular emotion a participant is experiencing, you can step up to support them. You can demonstrate warmth, human support, and clarity of direction to the participant. You may also need to do this again and again as different threads get picked up during the conversation. —Indi Young, [Building Rapport](https://medium.com/inclusive-software/building-rapport-b869cb7bb3d2)

## Asking questions
A professional interviewing style means that you neutrally phrase your questions. That's not to say you should act like a robot. But it is your job to interview in a natural and unbiased manner. Your opinions and emotional investment in the project do not matter during the interview. **Your job is to encourage the participant to talk without telling them what to say.**

Use Steve Portigal's list from [Seventeen types of interviewing questions](https://portigal.com/seventeen-types-of-interviewing-questions/) to help you probe for more profound answers during the interview. Begin to create a reference list that works for you or your team as you continue the program. 

### Questions to gather context and collect details
Ask about sequence. "Describe a typical workday. What do you do when you first sit down at your station? Then what do you do next?"

Ask about quantity. "How many files would you delete when that happens?"

Ask for specific examples. "What is the last movie you streamed?" – Compare this to "What movies do you stream?" The specific is easier to answer than the general and becomes a platform for follow up questions.

Ask for the complete list. "What are all the different apps you have installed on your smartphone?" – This will require a series of follow up questions, e.g., "What else?" because few people will be able to generate an entire list of something with some prompting.

Ask about relationships. "How do you work with new vendors?" – This general question is especially appropriate when you don't even know enough to ask a specific question (e.g. in comparison to the earlier example about streaming movies). Better to start general than to be presumptive with a too-specific question.

Ask about organizational structure. "Who does that department report to?"

### Questions to probe on what's unsaid
Ask for clarification. "When you refer to "that" you are talking about the newest server, right?"

Ask about code words/native language. "Why do you call it the 'Batcave?'"

Ask about emotional cues. "Why do you laugh when you mention 'Best Buy?'"

Ask why. "I've tried to get my boss to adopt this format, but she just won't do it-" "Why do you think she hasn't?"

Probe delicately. "You mentioned a difficult situation that changed your usage. Can you tell us what that situation was?"

Probe without presuming. "Some people have very negative feelings about Twitter, while others don't. What is your take?" – Rather than the direct "What do you think about Twitter?" or "Do you like Twitter?" This question introduces options that aren't tied to the interviewer or the interviewee.

Explain to an outsider. "Let's say that I've just arrived here from another decade, how would you explain to me the difference between smartphones and tablets?"

Teach another. "If you had to ask your daughter to operate your system, how would you explain it to her?"

### Questions that create contrasts to uncover frameworks and mental models
Compare processes. "What's the difference between sending your response by fax, mail or email?"

Compare to others. "Do the other coaches also do it that way?"

Compare across time. "How have your family photo activities changed in the past five years? How do you think they will be different five years from now?" – The second question is not intended to capture an accurate prediction. Rather, the question serves to break free from what exists now and envision possibilities that may emerge down the road. Identify the appropriately large time horizon (a year? Five years? Ten years?) that will help people to think beyond incremental change.

## Interviewing Best Practices
- **Use neutral, conversational cues** to keep the participant speaking and providing more detail or deeper reflections.
- **Do not rush through the questions or assume that silence indicates the participant has finished their thoughts.** Though awkward at first, Lingering silence cues the participant that there is more space for them: to take time to think, to reconsider, to add more detail. It also shows them that you prefer in-depth and longer answers.
- **Ask for specific examples and stories.** Anchoring participants in a particular time and place will help jog their memory, providing you with better data. People talk about recent memories with more accuracy than ones that occurred father out. 
- **Restate answers when appropriate.** Clarify terminology or concepts you don't understand. Don't try to come across as an expert in an unfamiliar subject. Asking for examples or clarification establishes mutual understanding and trust. But take care that you do not subtly insert your opinions or assumptions when you restate their answers.
- **Watch for clues like hesitant answers or contradictions.** Sometimes people will answer a different question than the one you asked or give an opinion that conflicts with something they stated previously.
