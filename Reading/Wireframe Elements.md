# Wireframe Elements
When creating wireframes, you’ll first need to understand the goals you’re aiming to achieve. What questions are you trying to answer? What ideas and assumptions do you need to test and validate? Then, based on your goals and project constraints (i.e., budget, time, etc.), you’ll determine the areas to focus on and the level of fidelity and detail needed. For the most part, wireframes use basic shapes (primarily boxes and lines) and shades of grey. Let’s review a few common wireframe elements.

## Images
Images are commonly depicted as a box with an “x” (see image A), but may also depict a basic line drawing of scenery (see image B).

## Videos
Videos can be depicted similar to an image, but they also include a triangle in the center (indicating a play button) to differentiate it from static media.

## Buttons/Call-to-actions (CTAs)
Buttons are often depicted as rectangles and, depending on the level of fidelity, will either include text that reads “CTA” or “button”, or the actual copy that will be used in the final product.

## Body Text and Headers
In lower fidelity wireframes, text will be displayed as a series of lines or long rectangles or [lorem ipsum](https://loremipsum.io/), also known as dummy or filler text. As you can see from the second image, headers are often differentiated through the adjustment of visual weight (i.e. sizing, contrast, font weight).
