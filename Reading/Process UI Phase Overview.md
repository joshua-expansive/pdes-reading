**Welcome to Process UI.**
In this phase you will learn the elements of 2D design and user interface patterns. We'll teach you to design great looking, user-friendly digital interfaces by using grids, color themes, layout principles, and the mechanisms of affordance. Accessibility and designing with OS guidelines for Apple and Android are also part of this phase. 

In **Project 1** you'll explore how to create early conceptual designs for a Biotech startup! 

In **Project 2** you start with a set of UX wireframes for an app that helps people deal with stress. You'll create the final UI designs for a prototype and conduct evaluation testing to make sure everything works great. 

After completing these projects, you will be ready to move on to Studio I. Keep going! üëè
