# Case Study Recommendations
## Project overview: the lead-in
A format that has become popular is providing an overview of the project upfront. It outlines the problem, the solutions and outcomes, and the basics of the project name, description, and role. All of this being lead by a simple visual showcase of the project solutions. This is a way to share, at a glance, the most basic details of the project. The lead-in sets the stage for all the information that follows for the reader’s benefit.
-   **Client or project name** and (optional) description of the company or a link out to the company website.
-   **Your role**
-   **Overview:** This is typically a two or three-sentence summary of the project or Client, the problem, and what was provided as a solution.
-   **Deliverables:** Write the major deliverables, no need to get too granular with “low-, mid-, and high-fidelity wireframes”; “Wireframes” will do.
-   **Tools** you used, both digital and analogue. 
-   **Project length** (optional): Use weeks or “X sprints of X days each.”

These high-level overviews of the project at the beginning or top of a full case study make it very scannable and digestible and can be quite brief and even list-like. 
## Project Overview: The Gate
If you use this overview as a gate to an entire case study, it’s recommended to make the overview a bit more robust than the list method or two-sentence approach. Give a more comprehensive insight to the project by writing a paragraph or two detailing: the problem or challenge of the project, which methods you leveraged, any user insights gained, the design decisions made towards solutions, and what were the outcomes and results, if any. Keep this overview short and sweet and leave out all the granular details. Given this overview is often not enough to tell the full detailed story, it’s recommended to provide a call to action to see a complete case study. This is where you can get into the details that some hiring managers may want to see.

## Design and Layout
If your case study looks like a long essay, the lack of hierarchy will discourage viewers. As a designer, you must add hierarchical and visual elements to your text and content. Here are some things to consider:
- Larger type for headlines and subheads
- Section dividers to break up or set up the text to follow
- A second typeface used to supplement or accent regular text
- Color for accent text or defining headlines or subheads
- ‘Bold’ essential words or phrases
- Putting text in list form, instead of paragraph form, and using bullets, numbers, plus signs, or other visual elements that catch the reader’s eye and make these stand out from paragraphs
- Pull out quotes to highlight user testing results, client feedback, or other external perspectives
- Visually presenting statistics or other essential numbers visually
- Images help communicate faster than words can and help break up text 
- Captions for images provide quick insight 
- Outbound links for more context and intentional visual separation
## Images
Images and assets can visualize something quicker than several paragraphs’ worth of text explaining it. Ask yourself: 
- Is there a visually compelling way to show your deliverables and synthesis?
- Are they easy to view and large enough for the viewer? 

Images are the time and place to demonstrate you are visually competent in your projects and when showcasing your projects.

Consider **Inline Annotations:** They are a dynamic way to provide information within an image. Unlike captions that have to summarize the image as a whole, inline annotations are ideal for delivering more explanation and pulling out specific insights and highlights.
- Simplify dense and detailed annotations by highlighting only key aspects of the design.
- Annotate visual deliverables that will be relevant to your case study, such as mood boards, style tiles, high-fidelity screens, marketing sites, design systems, etc.
- Always make sure your annotations are readable given the size of your image as well as the readers’ device

Once you use an image asset, be sure to **caption it**. This explains what the image is and then, more importantly why it’s in your case study. The best way to caption is with a different weight/size/color than regular text, so it stands out. The second-best is using normal text just before or just after the asset. Captions must be purposeful and consistent throughout the case study. They should not repeat information that the asset already explains and communicates; they must provide unique insight. Think of them as another chance to prove you can analyze and synthesize information.
## Best Practices
### Be Purposeful
Purposefulness means that every element has a reason to be there—and helps explain. That means every word, asset, every section, and every insight. When self-editing, it helps that you look at everything you created and determine its purposefulness. 

This helps ensure that you:
- Write the story that needs to be told
- Justify having each element and sentence
- Keep information and story concise

Besides having a purpose for each element, ensure your case study itself is serving the only reason it should be there. To walk through your work and skills in order to get the job you want. Parallel your case studies to the job you are seeking. 
- **UX Research:** Highlight those deliverables and speak to your research and what you learned. 
- **Interaction Design:** Focus on your content strategy and prototyping abilities. 
- **Product Design:** Show you can deliver and synthesize research materials, test prototypes as well as transform wireframes into high fidelity designs.
- **UI/Visual Design:** Be sure to show your ability to create and or extend design systems and brands.
- **Branding:** Write your case study around how you took it from concept to development.
### Use Outbound Links
Whenever referencing a company or any long-winded information, using outbound links will aid in keeping your case study concise and avoid over-explaining topics. Additionally:
- They allow you to provide more information like competitors or methods in an easy way by hiding explanations within the text
- They can provide some character and personality without disrupting the case study story flow
- They allow you to cite sources easily when pulling facts or information that may require a source reference
- They add another hierarchical level because they show up differently and serve to break up big chunks of text visually
## Examples
The examples provided here show a mix of different approaches to showing case studies. Some have a complete overview that is gated and links out to a fuller case study. Some are hosted on Medium.com. Others lean much heavier on the visuals to show their skills and tell the story.
