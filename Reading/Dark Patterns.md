# Dark Patterns
## The scope of the problem
[One published study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.07032.pdf) looked at 11,000 shopping sites and found that 11% use dark patterns. A typical example of dark patterns is the fine print on credit card applications. More appealing phrases like "0% down" and "low interest" are located front-and-center in the middle of the page. Information about hidden fees and future inflation is displayed in tiny font and relegated to the page's bottom. 

[Harry Brignull](https://www.90percentofeverything.com/about/), a UX consultant, coined the term "dark patterns" to refer to design elements that manipulate people into doing things they wouldn't otherwise do, to the benefit of the company. These patterns weaponize psychology and behavioral techniques to maximize profit or engagement. 

Dark patterns are intentionally subtle, persuasive, and very manipulative. They can often come disguised as helpful features in some of your favorite apps and websites. Have you ever wondered why Instagram stories only last 24-hours and then disappear? It's to keep you constantly checking the app for new stories. The app is hijacking your 'fear-of-missing-out' to keep you engaged.

## There is a backlash against using dark patterns
Dark patterns have been around for a while, but companies can now be held accountable in a court for exploiting users with these questionable business practices. A few years ago, [LinkedIn was sued](https://www.fastcompany.com/3051906/after-lawsuit-settlement-linkedins-dishonest-design-is-now-a-13-million-problem) for spamming its users to add contacts eight different times when setting up an account. This dark pattern's goal was to bring more people onto the platform: Users surrendered the email contacts during the signup process, which LinkedIn could then access and use. It ended up costing the platform 13 million dollars. 

[Congress has even considered bills]([bill](https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2019/4/senators-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-to-ban-manipulative-dark-patterns)) to regulate how dark patterns are applied.
