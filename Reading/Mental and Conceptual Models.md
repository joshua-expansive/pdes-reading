# Mental and Conceptual Models
In user experience design, the goal is to find a match between the users’ mental models and the product’s conceptual model to bring about positive and valuable experiences.

 ## Mental models
 Mental models are representations of a person’s intuitive understanding of how something functions based on past encounters, exposure to information, and sound judgment or intuitive perceptions (Source [UX Matters](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2016/05/mental-models-and-user-experience.php)). Mental models help shape people’s actions and behavior, influence what people pay attention to in complicated situations, and define how people approach and solve problems. 
 
 [K.J.W. Craik](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth\_Craik) was the first to discuss mental models in his 1943 book, [The Nature of Explanation](http://amzn.com/0521094453). The book sat dormant until the 1980’s when the term reappeared in two books published with similar titles of Mental Models. [Indi Young](https://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/mental-models/#:~:text=Mental%20Models%20gives%20you%20the,making%20design%20strategic%2C%20and%20successful.) wrote a book in 2008 also called Mental Models; however, she uses the term differently as she diagrams the behavior of a particular audience doing a series of tasks, and includes their goals and motivations. Underneath this task flow, she describes what the “system” or product will do or be like, to match the user’s task. Young called this entire deliverable a “mental model” while others would call it a User Journey Map or Task Analysis.

 ## Conceptual models
A conceptual model is the actual designs or ideas given to the user through the product’s interface. Someone designed a user interface, and that interface communicates to you the conceptual model of the product.

Task analysis, observational research, data mining, and user interviews are good ways to understand a user’s mental model. Leveraging the [thinking aloud method](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/thinking-aloud-the-1-usability-tool/#:~:text=Definition%3A%20In%20a%20thinking%20aloud,keep%20up%20a%20running%20monologue.), hearing users verbalize what they think, believe, and predict while using a product during interviews or user testing is a great way to get insights into a user’s mental model.

## Bringing the two together
People struggle to use an interface if it doesn’t match their mental model. Usability testing is the method that typically reveals this disconnect. Patterns become patterns when lots of people agree that there is a connection between mental and conceptual models. During a usability test, if users struggle to use common patterns, it is probably because the conceptual model is not a good match for their (correct) mental model. 

When a unique pattern is first introduced, it might not match people’s mental models. It takes time for a pattern to become widely adopted and accepted. Just because people struggle initially with a new pattern does not mean that the design has to change. It might be the case that users need to update their mental models to match the new conceptual model. You should only introduce a new conceptual model if it is genuinely required. Standard practices in digital interfaces are embedded in users’ mental models, and mental models are difficult to shift.
