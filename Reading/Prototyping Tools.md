# Prototyping Tools

In recent years, there's been a veritable explosion of prototyping tools in the design industry. While this has been a great boon to designers everywhere, and though there are [annual reports](https://uxtools.co/survey-2020/#prototyping) of what is prevalent in the industry, **the challenge now is in knowing when to use which tools, the benefits of which, costs associated with each, and knowing which are worth learning or adopting to be used by design team and their respective company**. Though there are lots of digital tools out there, and even knowing HTML and CSS may be a way to prototype, the most notable prototyping tools are:
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - A relatively new comer (started in 2012) but has become a leading design tool for vector based graphics editing and prototyping. It’s adaptability is mainly a result of it’s [freemium](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Freemium) offering and the fact it’s primarily web-based, (with additional offline features enabled by desktop applications for macOS and Windows).
- [InVision](http://invisionapp.com/) - A very popular tool known for its ability to make prototypes quickly and easily to be shared with stakeholders who can also provide feedback within the same tool. [InVision Studio](https://www.invisionapp.com/studio), released in 2011, is it’s next generation offering more prototyping capabilities and design team collaboration features. 
- [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd/features.html) - A vector-based design and prototyping tool first released in 2016 by a design industry giant Adobe Inc in response to Sketch’s rise in popularity by designers. You can quickly go from wireframes and mockups to static UI designs to interactive prototypes that simulate a user experience — using just XD for the whole design process.
- [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/for-designers/) - Released in 2010 as a vector based digital interface tool for designers, Sketch became the software of choice for digital designers. Originally focused on only interface design, it’s now adopted to user needs and offers prototyping and collaboration capabilities like it’s competitors. Extensions, plugins and integrations for Sketch, created by a large community, make it easy to expand on Sketch’s capabilities.
