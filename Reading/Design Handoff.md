# Design Handoff
Passing design deliverables from one team to another (or to a client) isn’t always as easy as it sounds. As a designer, your communication and documentation should be well-organized, up-to-date, and coherent enough to convey necessary knowledge about each deliverable. Those receiving your designs don’t want to have to piece together the minute details without a guiding picture. That’s why handing off your designs should be done according to a standardized process with specific guidelines and clear expectations. 

Handoff is a detailed process, so it’s best to follow a set checklist to ensure you have a successful handoff, whether you’re giving designs to the client or the development team. On a high level, you want to check that your design system is cleaned up and tidy and that your user interface elements are consistent: Buttons should have the same aesthetic and spacing, and tables, carousels, navigation, etc., should be relatively uniform. 

When you check your design system for efficiency and cohesiveness before handoff, complete the following tactical checklist.
## Clean up stage
1.  Delete all unused design iterations, layers, symbols, and guides instead of just hiding them to avoid developer confusion
2.  Group layers and name them appropriately with an agreed-on naming convention to help with finding and working with elements
3.  Ensure design account for different states: empty, filled-in, edge case, error, success, etc
4.  Ensure designs are fully accessible, looking minimally at color contrast and sizing for legibility 
5.  Clean up text styles, so there is clear consistency in header and text styles header 1, header 2, etc.
6.  Clean up color usage and swatches, so there are not unintended multiple versions of the same color
7.  Use an inspection tool like [Sketch Measure](https://utom.design/measure.html) to ensure consistency in your designs, such as spacing and other visual elements
## Production stage
8.  Icons and graphics should be exported in SVG format if not PNG, wherever possible
9.  [Raster images](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Raster_graphics), such as photographs or complicated graphics, should be exported in JPG format. Include versions at [1x and at 2x (and 3x](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/icons-and-images/image-size-and-resolution/) if the project requires it).
10.  Typefaces and fonts to be delivered in TTF/OTF and WOFF web format 
11.  Color system should be in HEX format
## Documentation / Annotation Stage
12.  All documentation stays update-to-date as designs evolve (if there is an existing style guide or design system in place)
13.  All documentation is in a centralized style guide or design system (if not yet in existence). This ensures designs will be leveraged for future developments and iterations of the project or brand; this could include even documentation on brand/design principles and even research artifacts such as personas, user flows, and research findings.
14.  Designs are not obstructed with your annotations. If you decide to add your annotations in-line, be sure to be purposeful and not crowd the page. 
15.  Documentation is thorough but concise.
16.  Documentation is written for all possible audiences: UX/UI/visual designers, interaction designers, developers/software engineers, and other key stakeholders like leadership, marketing, etc. 
17.  Interactions, transitions, animations, and micro-interactions are properly documented, annotated and/or demonstrated with prototypes
18.  Different states, cases, and gesture nuances are annotated where applicable 
19.  Visual design specifications such as grids, color values, dimensions, font sizes, margins, padding, etc are documented
20.  Accessibility is documented, providing focus order and alt tags for elements to aid in screen reader
21.  Device, screen and/or resolution specifications are documented
22.  Code snippets for reusable components are included (if working with a developer to develop documentation)
23.  Links to downloadable assets such as logos, UI kits, color swatches, code repositories, etc. are included
24.  Include metadata for the documentation, including contact information and version tracking numerics or dates
