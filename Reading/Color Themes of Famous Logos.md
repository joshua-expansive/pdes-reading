# Color Schemes
A color scheme or palette is the intentional choice of color combinations and relationships used in a design. They’re an excellent way to avoid using too many colors, which can ultimately lessen the impact of each color used. When it comes to creating a color scheme, the colors you choose aren’t the only key decisions. It’s also important to consider how you use the colors. Many designers follow the 60-30-10 rule, which states that color schemes work best when used in these specific proportions: 60% primary/dominant color, 30% secondary/supporting color, and 10% accent color. We’ll review a few basic color schemes with examples of them executed well.

## Monochromatic
A monochromatic color scheme is composed of lighter versions (tints) and darker versions (shades). This is a good option when you’re aiming to do less with more and avoid getting overly complex with a design. It makes it easy for a design to look cohesive but at the risk of becoming monotonous.

## Complementary
A complementary color scheme is composed of opposite colors on the color wheel. The high contrast of complementary colors creates a vibrant look, especially when used at full saturation, and is a great option when needing to make different elements appear distinct from another.

## Split Complementary
A split complementary color scheme is composed by joining a hue with the two hues beside its complementary color. This color scheme creates the same visual contrast as seen in the complementary color scheme but provides more creative options for color usage.

## Analogous
An analogous color scheme is composed of colors that sit next to one another on the color wheel and are adjacent to the base color on the hue spectrum. When leveraging this color scheme, designate one color to be the dominant color, one to be the supporting color, and one to be an accent color. This will help to create a cohesive, unified feel and to avoid competing colors.

## Triadic
A triadic color scheme is composed of colors equally spaced around the color wheel, forming an equilateral triangle within the color wheel. This results in a diverse yet balanced color scheme.

## Tetradic
A triadic color scheme is composed of two sets of complementary colors, forming a square or rectangle on the color wheel. This color scheme is always made up of two warmer and two cooler hues, so it’s important to be conscious of how the warm and cool hues interact with one another to not compete with one another. It can also be helpful to establish dominant and accent colors.
