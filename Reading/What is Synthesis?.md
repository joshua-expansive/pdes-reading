# Synthesis
Synthesis involves the “thinking” part of design thinking. At its core, synthesis uses multiple ways of thinking across a variety of information sources to understand and solve a problem. The information sources may come anywhere–primary ethnographic data, company analytics, client priorities, or desktop research. While analysis breaks information into parts (themes, buckets, patterns), synthesis creates a new whole out of the re-combined pieces. 

## Synthesis happens throughout the design process
Synthesis occurs throughout the project in a variety of informal ways—what UX technologist Heidi S. Toussaint calls, “[synthesis on the go](https://medium.com/mixed-methods/rapid-ux-research-at-google-3b92dd038e30).” It occurs during quick whiteboarding sessions with the team or when sharing stories from user interviews. It might be while sketching your thoughts alone or during cross-functional brainstorming. Synthesis also occurs when you design artifacts (like journey maps, process flows, or information architecture diagrams) because you are pruning away the irrelevant information and creating new interpretations of what matters.

There are times when synthesis should be more structured and explicit. When you need to narrow options, prioritize or center focus, or converge on an opportunity space—that’s when you turn to knowledge-building exercises and methods like affinity mapping. All of this points to synthesis as a “[constant process of acquisition, reflection, and action.](http://www.drs2010.umontreal.ca/data/PDF/067.pdf)” 

## Synthesis at work
As a simple example, imagine that a design team needs to increase the metric of ‘customers-served-per-hour’ at a popular fast-food restaurant. They first conduct observational research during a busy shift and document breakdowns in communication and redundant tasks. They also see how easily flow is disrupted in the kitchen when employees scramble to find and use specific tools. 

Rather than pointing out problems and immediately jumping to solutions, the researchers want to observe a team of people regarded for how well they function in a high-pressure environment. 

They decide to observe and document the behaviors of a pit crew during an auto race. What they see is a [tightly choreographed routine](https://www.wired.com/2015/06/how-nascar-pit-stops-work/#:~:text=Crew%20members%20stand%20by%20with,5%20seconds.&text=The%20right%20tires%2C%20those%20on,pit%20box%2C%20are%20serviced%20first) of “controlled chaos.” Subtle information signals pass between the crew members at breakneck speed, and they see how success depends on the economy of motion.

By extrapolating principles of efficiency and order from watching the behavior of the pit crew, the team can examine their research from the restaurant with a new lens and expand their horizon of understanding. They now have a rich palette of stories and examples. They can use analogy (a good restaurant staff is like a pit crew) or metaphor (get the customer ‘back on the track’ as fast as possible). 

Insights and ideas that emerge in this manner can lead to more innovative design solutions. **By combining seemingly unrelated data points, new meanings and possibilities pop into existence.** 

When it comes to researching the problem space, synthesis often leads to re-framing the problem. A designer’s viewpoint–or [frame](http://www.jonkolko.com/writingSensemaking.php)–is subjective and shaped “over the long-term aggregation of thoughts and experiences.” In a collaborative environment, the framing of the problem may change multiple times during research. By embracing multiple perspectives, synthesis becomes a shared activity, producing valuable knowledge for teams to solve problems.
