# How to Own Your Design Decisions
## Giving Agency Back to the Designer
Nothing can be more deflating than getting out of a meeting where the client is unsatisfied with what they saw. Not only does this mean going back to the drawing board, but it’s a hit to the ego that is likely already bruised from battling [imposter syndrome.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) How can we, as designers, own our design decisions and push back against a client?

As the saying goes, “the best defense is a good offense.” While you should never think of the relationship between the client and the designer as two opposing views, there are ways to stay ahead of the ball to mitigate future friction.
## Pair Design
Pair designing is where two people work together collaboratively on a single problem to come up with a design solution. It is a great way to engage the client, bring them into the design process, and help mold their ideas while understanding their business considerations. This works for both parties since you increase mutual understanding of your design reasoning through knowledge transfer. While the best use case for this is having the client participate periodically throughout the design process, engaging the client at the beginning of the design process will allow them to understand how you came to your design solutions.
## Lean on Design Principles and Values of the Company
Design principles aren’t just a step in the design process towards completing a successful sprint. Each one of your principles should be carried through every design decision you make. Like how a design system or style guide informs how to align all elements to create a cohesive brand, design principles need to transcend every aspect of the design. Are the icons accessible? Does the copy reflect that of the brand? Does this design satisfy user needs based on insights and reflect the product in a positive light? If a design decision is made without thoughtful consideration and alignment with the values, the decision can be contradictory to other efforts. Agreeing on design principles with relevant stakeholders is essential to ensuring a successful product and alignment with the company values.
## Speak in Numbers
Whether your stakeholder is an analyst, a financial backer, the CEO of the company, or a developer, numbers equate to value. Doing your research before jumping into a meeting is always advised–even for a design consultation. If you have any data or analytics to back your design decisions, use them. Qualitative findings help provide context for your stakeholders. If you have a good pull quote from an interview that speaks to the data you’re suggesting, add a slide to help your audience empathize with their user.  
  
If there is not enough data to prove or disprove a statement, be sure to communicate that clearly to your stakeholder and follow-up with plans to dig deeper. They’ll appreciate the transparency, even if a finding is presumed only to be proven correct or incorrect later. If there is some data, even loosely to frame what you’re building these hypotheses, that will suffice.
## Alternative Design Directions
On the occasion that in an exploratory sprint, the results produce variations in designs, be mindful of how to display alternative designs and explain this to the client. Breakdown and compare the design decisions of each design variant. Demonstrate that alternative designs are still in line with project goals and values. Variants are not a sign of lack of confidence but a showcase that there can be multiple solutions possible for the project.  
## Getting Back on Your Feet
If you find yourself in a situation where you’re completely stumped, perhaps the stakeholder found a loophole in your design and pounced. Inform the stakeholder that you are aware of their counterpoint. You hear and understand their view and that you’ll consider their feedback for the next sprint where you iterate towards a better design. This will remind the client that the design process itself is iterative, and because of that, outcomes will be more successful. 

Owning your design decisions sometimes means that your choices were wrong. As a designer, it is our job to question everything. Perhaps you took a bad piece of information and fell down the wrong rabbit hole. On the other hand, maybe you decided to chase assumptions rather than research different perspectives, and the client discovered the flaw in your process. There is nothing wrong with admitting you went down the wrong path; it’s better to own it and confirm with the client that the project can move back to a place of confidence given some time.
