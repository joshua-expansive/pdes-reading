# Licensing Fonts

As you begin to consider which typefaces are most appropriate for your design, it’s good to know what font options you have to work with. 

**System fonts** are pre-installed fonts on the operating system of a computer or mobile device. These fonts have no licensing costs and can maximize performance speed since the font files are already available on the device. However, they don’t stand out because they’re so widely used.

**Open-source licensed fonts** are released for anyone to use, share, and modify for free. Because these fonts are free, they’ve garnered much debate throughout the design industry, with many professional designers viewing them as unrefined or incomplete. Free fonts were produced mainly by more novice designers or released without complete font families. Nowadays, many high-quality, free fonts are made available through open-source communities, with even large companies such as [Adobe](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts) and [Google](https://fonts.google.com/) participating.

**Professional fonts** are sold either directly from font designers or retail font sites. The cost of professional fonts can range anywhere from a couple of bucks to $200 or more. While price doesn’t necessarily translate into quality, many designers swear by using professional fonts, as they often offer a higher caliber of quality and rarity than free fonts. Professional fonts are considered intellectual property, and as such, they require obtaining a font license to use them. A font license is an agreement granting permission to use a font, as long as the specific terms of that agreement are upheld. Some common types of font licenses are:
- **Desktop and print licenses** allow a font to be installed on a computer and used in design programs  and software to create static images, such as prints, posters, t-shirts, business cards, etc. This is considered an individual personal license.
- **Commercial licenses** come into play when fonts are used for commercial or profit purposes. Depending on the typeface, the commercial license may or may not be required if used in a for-profit business. There are various commercial license types, each with a range of costs, and even if a designer working on a client project personally owns specific licenses to fonts, will need to acquire the rights to use it for the masses. A few standard commercial licenses include:
	- **Desktop and print licenses** allow a font to be installed on a computer and used in design programs and software to create static images, such as prints, posters, t-shirts, business cards, etc. This is considered an individual personal license.
	- **Commercial licenses** are for commercial or for-profit use. Depending on the typeface, the commercial license may or may not be required if used in a for-profit business. There are various commercial license types, each with a range of costs, and even if a designer working on a client project personally owns specific licenses to fonts, they will need to acquire the rights to use it for the masses. A few standard commercial licenses include:
		- **Mobile licenses** are used exclusively for a mobile application.
		- **Server licenses** are exclusively for distribution on a server shared with teams and organizations.
		- **Epub licenses** are exclusively for electronic publications.
		- **Digital ad licenses** are used exclusively for advertising in the digital space.
		- **Webfont licenses** allow a font to be used online across various platforms since they’re embedded into the code to ensure it works properly.

For fonts that require purchasing a license, make sure to review the terms of the agreement in detail. A common oversight is purchasing a single-user license and then using that typeface commercially when working on client projects. It’s considered a direct violation of that license and could result in legal action. Another common oversight is assuming that fonts marketed as “free download” are free for any usage. Many of these typefaces are only free for personal use but must be licensed when used commercially.
